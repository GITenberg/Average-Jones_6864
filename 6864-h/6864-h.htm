    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. THE B-FLAT TROMBONE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three men sat in the Cosmic Club discussing the question: &ldquo;What's the
      matter with Jones?&rdquo; Waldemar, the oldest of the conferees, was the owner,
      and at times the operator, of an important and decent newspaper. His heavy
      face wore the expression of good-humored power, characteristic of the
      experienced and successful journalist. Beside him sat Robert Bertram, the
      club idler, slender and languidly elegant. The third member of the
      conference was Jones himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones had come by his nickname inevitably. His parents had
      foredoomed him to it when they furnished him with the initials A. V. R. E.
      as preface to his birthright of J for Jones. His character apparently
      justified the chance concomitance. He was, so to speak, a composite
      photograph of any thousand well-conditioned, clean-living Americans
      between the ages of twenty-five and thirty. Happily, his otherwise
      commonplace face was relieved by the one unfailing characteristic of
      composite photographs, large, deep-set and thoughtful eyes. Otherwise he
      would have passed in any crowd, and nobody would have noticed him pass.
      Now, at twenty-seven, he looked back over the five years since his
      graduation from college and wondered what he had done with them; and at
      the four previous years of undergraduate life and wondered how he had done
      so well with those and why he had not in some manner justified the parting
      words of his favorite professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have one rare faculty, Jones. You can, when you choose, sharpen the
      pencil of your mind to a very fine point. Specialize, my boy, specialize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If the recipient of this admonition had specialized in anything, it was in
      life. Having twenty-five thousand a year of his own he might have
      continued in that path indefinitely, but for two influences. One was an
      irruptive craving within him to take some part in the dynamic activities
      of the surrounding world. The other was the &ldquo;freak&rdquo; will of his late and
      little-lamented uncle, from whom he had his present income, and his future
      expectations of some ten millions. Adrian Van Reypen Egerton had, as
      Waldemar once put it, &ldquo;&mdash;one into the mayor's chair with a good name
      and come out with a block of ice stock.&rdquo; In a will whose cynical humor was
      the topic of its day, Mr. Egerton jeered posthumously at the public which
      he had despoiled, and promised restitution, of a sort, through his heir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; he had written, &ldquo;I give and bequeath to the said Adrian Van
      Reypen Egerton Jones, the residue of my property, the principal to be
      taken over by him at such time as he shall have completed five years of
      continuous residence in New York City. After such time the virus of the
      metropolis will have worked through his entire being. He will squander his
      unearned and undeserved fortune, thus completing the vicious circle, and
      returning the millions acquired by my political activities, in a poisoned
      shower upon the city, for which, having bossed, bullied and looted it, I
      feel no sentiment other than contempt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; remarked Waldemar in his heavy, rumbling voice, &ldquo;you aspire to
      disappoint that good old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only human nature, you know,&rdquo; said Average Jones. &ldquo;When a man puts a
      ten-million-dollar curse on you and suggests that you haven't the backbone
      of a shrimp, you&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;naturally yearn to prove him a liar,&rdquo; supplied Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. Anyway, I've no taste for dissipation, either moral or
      financial. I want action; something to do. I'm bored in this infernal
      city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wail of the unslaked romanticist,&rdquo; commented Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Romanticist nothing!&rdquo; protested the other. &ldquo;My ambitions are practical
      enough if I could only get 'em stirred up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. Boredom is simply romanticism with a morning-after thirst.
      You're panting for romance, for something bizarre. Egypt and St.
      Petersburg and Buenos Ayres and Samoa have all become commonplace to you.
      You've overdone them. That's why you're back here in New York waiting with
      stretched nerves for the Adventure of Life to cat-creep up from behind and
      toss the lariat of rainbow dreams over your shoulders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Waldemar laughed. &ldquo;Not a bad diagnosis. Why don't you take up a hobby, Mr.
      Jones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a hobby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any kind. The club is full of hobby-riders. Of all people that I know,
      they have the keenest appetite for life. Look at old Denechaud; he was a
      misanthrope until he took to gathering scarabs. Fenton, over there, has
      the finest collection of circus posters in the world. Bellerding's house
      is a museum of obsolete musical instruments. De Gay collects venomous
      insects from all over the world; no harmless ones need apply. Terriberry
      has a mania for old railroad tickets. Some are really very curious. I've
      often wished I had the time to be a crank. It's a happy life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What line would you choose?&rdquo; asked Bertram languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody has gone in for queer advertisements yet, I believe,&rdquo; replied the
      older man. &ldquo;If one could take the time to follow them up&mdash;-but it
      would mean all one's leisure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it be so demanding a career?&rdquo; said Average Jones, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly. I once knew a man who gave away twenty dollars daily on clues
      from the day's news. He wasn't bored for lack of occupation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the ordinary run of advertising is nothing more than an effort to
      sell something by yelling in print,&rdquo; objected Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it? Well perhaps you don't look in the right place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Waldemar reached for the morning's copy of the Universal and ran his eye
      down the columns of &ldquo;classified&rdquo; matter. &ldquo;Hark to this,&rdquo; he said, and
      read:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Is there any work on God's green
     earth for a man who has just got
     to have it?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or this:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;WANTED&mdash;A venerable looking man with
     white beard and medical degree.  Good
     pay to right applicant.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; asked Average Jones with awakened interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a quack medical concern looking for a stall to impress their
      come-ons,&rdquo; explained Waldemar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones leaned over to scan the paper in his turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's one,&rdquo; said he, and read:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     WANTED&mdash;Performer on B-flat trombone.
     Can use at once.  Apply with instrument,
     after 1 p. m. 300 East 100th Street.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That seems ordinary enough,&rdquo; said Waldemar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's it doing in a daily paper? There must be&mdash;er&mdash;technical
      publications&mdash;er&mdash;journals, you know, for this sort of demand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Average's words come slow, you've got him interested,&rdquo; commented
      Bertram. &ldquo;Sure sign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, he's right,&rdquo; said Waldemar. &ldquo;It is rather misplaced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is this for one that says what it means?&rdquo; said Bertram.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     WANTED&mdash;At once, a brass howitzer and
     a man who isn't afraid to handle it.
     Mrs. Anne Cullen, Pier 49  1/2  East River.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman who is fighting the barge combine,&rdquo; explained Waldemar. &ldquo;Not so
      good as it looks. She's bluffing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway, I'd like a shy at this business,&rdquo; declared Average Jones with
      sudden conviction. &ldquo;It looks to me like something to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it a business, then,&rdquo; advised Waldemar. &ldquo;If you care really to go in
      for it, my newspaper would be glad to pay for information such as you
      might collect. We haven't time, for example, to trace down fraudulent
      advertisers. If you could start an enterprise of that sort, you'd
      certainly find it amusing, and, at times, perhaps, even adventurous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't know how to establish it,&rdquo; objected Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newspaper owner drew a rough diagram on a sheet of paper and filled it
      in with writing, crossing out and revising liberally. Divided, upon his
      pattern, into lines, the final draft read:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ad-Visor! Do you expect me to blight my budding career by a poisonous pun
      like that?&rdquo; demanded Average Jones with a wry face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be a poisonous pun, but it's an arresting catch-word,&rdquo; said
      Waldemar, unmoved. &ldquo;Single column, about fifty lines will do it in nice,
      open style. Caps and lower case, and black-faced type for the name and
      title. Insert twice a week in every New York and Brooklyn paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it&mdash;er&mdash;a little blatant?&rdquo; suggested Bertram, with lifted
      eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blatant?&rdquo; repeated its inventor. &ldquo;It's more than that. It's howlingly
      vulgar. It's a riot of glaring yellow. How else would you expect to catch
      the public?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose, then, I do burst into flame to this effect?&rdquo; queried the
      prospective &ldquo;Ad-Visor.&rdquo; &ldquo;Et apres? as we proudly say after spending a week
      in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apres? Oh, plenty of things. You hire an office, a clerk, two
      stenographers and a clipping export, and prepare to take care of the work
      that comes in. You'll be flooded,&rdquo; promised Waldemar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And between times I'm to go skipping about, chasing long white whiskers
      and brass howitzers and B-flat trombones, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until you get your work systematized you'll have no time for skipping.
      Within six months, if you're not sandbagged or jailed on fake libel suits,
      you'll have a unique bibliography of swindles. Then I'll begin to come and
      buy your knowledge to keep my own columns clean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speaker looked up to meet the gaze of an iron-gray man with a harsh,
      sallow face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse my interrupting,&rdquo; said the new-comer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just one question, Waldemar. Who's going to be the nominee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Linder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Linder? Surely not! Why, his name hasn't been heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Federal job?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He resigns in two weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His record will kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What record? You and I know he's a grafter. But can we prove anything?
      His clerk has always handled all the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn't there an old scandal&mdash;a woman case?&rdquo;' asked the questioner
      vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Washington man's wife? Too old. Linder would deny it flatly, and
      there would be no witnesses. The woman is dead&mdash;killed by his brutal
      treatment of her, they say. But the whole thing was hushed up at the time
      by Linder's pull, and when the husband threatened to kill him Linder
      quietly set a commissioner of insanity on the case and had the man put
      away. He's never appeared since. No, that wouldn't be politically
      effective.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gray man nodded, and walked away, musing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egbert, the traction boss,&rdquo; explained Waldemar. &ldquo;We're generally on
      opposite sides, but this time we're both against Linder. Egbert wants a
      cheaper man for mayor. I want a straighter one. And I could get him this
      year if Linder wasn't so well fortified. However, to get back to our
      project, Mr. Jones&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Get back to it they did with such absorption that when the group broke up,
      several hours later, Average Jones was committed, by plan and rote, to the
      new and hopeful adventure of Life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the great human hunt which ever has been and ever shall be till &ldquo;the
      last bird flies into the last light&rdquo;&mdash;some call it business, some
      call it art, some call it love, and a very few know it for what it is, the
      very mainspring of existence&mdash;the path of the pursuer and the prey
      often run obscurely parallel. What time the Honorable William Linder
      matured his designs on the mayoralty, Average Jones sat in a suite of
      offices in Astor Court, a location which Waldemar had advised as being
      central, expensive, and inspirational of confidence, and considered, with
      a whirling brain, the minor woes of humanity. Other people's troubles had
      swarmed down upon him in answer to his advertised offer of help, as
      sparrows flock to scattered bread crumbs. Mostly these were of the lesser
      order of difficulties; but for what he gave in advice and help the
      Ad-Visor took payment in experience and knowledge of human nature. Still
      it was the hard, honest study, and the helpful toil which held him to his
      task, rather than the romance and adventure which he had hoped for and
      Waldemar had foretold&mdash;until, in a quiet, street in Brooklyn, of
      which he had never so much as heard, there befell that which, first of
      many events, justified the prophetic Waldemar and gave Average Jones a
      part in the greater drama of the metropolis. The party of the second part
      was the Honorable William Linder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr., Linder sat at five P. m., of an early summer day, behind lock and
      bolt. The third floor front room of his ornate mansion on Brooklyn's Park
      Slope was dedicated to peaceful thought. Sprawled in a huge and softly
      upholstered chair at the window, he took his ease in his house. The chair
      had been a recent gift from an anonymous admirer whose political
      necessities, the Honorable Mr. Linder idly surmised, had not yet driven
      him to reveal his identity. Its occupant stretched his shoeless feet, as
      was his custom, upon the broad window-sill, flooded by the seasonable
      warmth of sunshine, the while he considered the ripening mayoralty
      situation. He found it highly satisfactory. In the language of his inner
      man, it was a cinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below, in Kennard Street, a solitary musician plodded. His pretzel-shaped
      brass rested against his shoulder. He appeared to be the &ldquo;scout&rdquo; of one of
      those prevalent and melancholious German bands, which, under Brooklyn's
      easy ordinances, are privileged to draw echoes of the past writhing from
      their forgotten recesses. The man looked slowly about him as if apprising
      potential returns. His gravid glance encountered the prominent feet in the
      third story window of the Linder mansion, and rested. He moved forward.
      Opposite the window he paused. He raised the mouthpiece to his lips and
      embarked on a perilous sea of notes from which the tutored ear might have
      inferred that once popular ditty, Egypt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love of music was not one of the Honorable William Linder's attributes. An
      irascible temper was. Of all instruments the B-flat trombone possesses the
      most nerve-jarring tone. The master of the mansion leaped from his restful
      chair. Where his feet had ornamented the coping his face now appeared. Far
      out he leaned, and roared at the musician below. The brass throat blared
      back at him, while the soloist, his eyes closed in the ecstasy of art,
      brought the &ldquo;verse&rdquo; part of his selection to an excruciating conclusion,
      half a tone below pitch. Before the chorus there was a brief pause for
      effect. In this pause, from Mr. Linder's open face a voice fell like a
      falling star. Although it did not cry &ldquo;Excelsior,&rdquo; its output of vocables
      might have been mistaken, by a casual ear, for that clarion call. What the
      Honorable Mr. Linder actually shouted was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Getthehelloutofhere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The performer upturned a mild and vacant face. &ldquo;What you say?&rdquo; he inquired
      in a softly Teutonic accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honorable William Linder made urgent gestures, like a brakeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away! Move on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The musician smiled reassuringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got already paid for this,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up went the brass to his lips again. The tonal stairway which leads up to
      the chorus of Egypt rose in rasping wailfulness. It culminated in an
      excessive, unendurable, brazen shriek&mdash;and the Honorable William
      Linder experienced upon the undefended rear of his person the most violent
      kick of a lifetime not always devoted to the arts of peace. It projected
      him clear of the window-sill. His last sensible vision was the face of the
      musician, the mouth absurdly hollow and pursed above the suddenly removed
      mouthpiece. Then an awning intercepted the politician's flight. He passed
      through this, penetrated a second and similar stretch of canvas shading
      the next window below, and lay placid on his own front steps with three
      ribs caved in and a variegated fracture of the collar-bone. By the time
      the descent was ended the German musician had tucked his brass under his
      arm and was hurrying, in panic, down the street, his ears still ringing
      with the concussion which had blown the angry householder from his own
      front window. He was intercepted by a running policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was the explosion?&rdquo; demanded the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explosion? I hear a noise in the larch house on the corner,&rdquo; replied the
      musician dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman grabbed his arm. &ldquo;Come along back. You fer a witness! Come
      on; you an' yer horn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It iss not a horn,&rdquo; explained the German patiently, &ldquo;'it iss a B-flat
      trombone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Along with several million other readers, Average Jones followed the
      Linder &ldquo;bomb outrage&rdquo; through the scandalized head-lines of the local
      press. The perpetrator, declared the excited journals, had been skilful.
      No clue was left. The explosion had taken care of that. The police (with
      the characteristic stupidity of a corps of former truck-drivers and
      bartenders, decorated with brass buttons and shields and without further
      qualification dubbed &ldquo;detectives&rdquo;) vacillated from theory to theory. Their
      putty-and-pasteboard fantasies did not long survive the Honorable William
      Linder's return to consciousness and coherence. An &ldquo;inside job,&rdquo; they had
      said. The door was locked and bolted, Mr. Linder declared, and there was
      no possible place for an intruder to conceal himself. Clock-work, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would any human being guess what time to set it for,&rdquo; demanded the
      politician in disgust, &ldquo;when I never know, myself, where I'm going to be
      at any given hour of any given day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that Dutch horn-player threw the bomb,&rdquo; propounded the head of the
      &ldquo;Detective Bureau&rdquo; ponderously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; tossed it right up, three stories, and kept playing his
      infernal trombone with the other hand all the time. You ought to be
      carrying a hod!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the police hung tenaciously to the theory that the musician
      was involved, chiefly because they had nothing else to hang to. The
      explosion had been very localized, the room not generally wrecked; but the
      chair which seemed to be the center of disturbance, and from which the
      Honorable William Linder had risen just in time to save his life, was
      blown to pieces, and a portion of the floor beneath it was much shattered.
      The force of the explosion had been from above the floor downward; not up
      through the flooring. As to murderously inclined foes, Mr. Linder
      disclaimed knowledge of any. The notion that the trombonist had given a
      signal he derided as an &ldquo;Old Sleuth pipe-dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As time went on and &ldquo;clues&rdquo; came to nothing, the police had no greater
      concern than quietly to forget, according to custom, a problem beyond
      their limited powers. With the release of the German musician, who was
      found to be simple-minded to the verge of half-wittedness, public interest
      waned, and the case faded out of current print.
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones, who was much occupied with a pair of blackmailers operating
      through faked photographs, about that time, had almost forgotten the
      Linder case, when, one day, a month after the explosion, Waldemar dropped
      in at the Astor Court offices. He found a changed Jones; much thinner and
      &ldquo;finer&rdquo; than when, eight weeks before, he had embarked on his new career,
      at the newspaper owner's instance. The young man's color was less
      pronounced, and his eyes, though alert and eager, showed rings under them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have found the work interesting, I take it,&rdquo; remarked the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ra&mdash;ather,&rdquo; drawled Average Jones appreciatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a good initial effort, running down the opium pill mail-order
      enterprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was simple enough as soon as I saw the catchword in the 'Wanted'
      line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything is easy to a man who sees,&rdquo; returned the older man
      sententiously. &ldquo;The open eye of the open mind&mdash;that has more to do
      with real detective work than all the deduction and induction and analysis
      ever devised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the detective part that interests me most in the game, but I
      haven't had much of it, yet. You haven't run across any promising ads
      lately, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Waldemar's wide, florid brow wrinkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't thought or dreamed of anything for a month but this infernal
      bomb explosion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the Linder case. You're personally interested?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Politically. It makes Linder's nomination certain. Persecution. Attempted
      assassination. He becomes a near-martyr. I'm almost ready to believe that
      he planted a fake bomb himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And fell out of a third-story window to carry out the idea? That's
      pushing realism rather far, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Waldemar laughed. &ldquo;There's the weakness. Unless we suppose that he
      under-reckoned the charge of explosive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They let the musician go, didn't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. There was absolutely no proof against him, except that he was in the
      street below. Besides, he seemed quite lacking mentally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mightn't that have been a sham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alienists, of good standing examined him. They reported him just a shade
      better than half-witted. He was like a one-ideaed child, his whole being
      comprised in his ability, and ambition to play his B-flat trombone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I needed an accomplice,&rdquo; said Average Jones thoughtfully, &ldquo;I
      wouldn't want any better one than a half-witted man. Did he play well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Atrociously. And if you know what a soul-shattering blare exudes from a
      B-flat trombone&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Waldemar lifted expressive hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within Average Jones' overstocked mind something stirred at the repetition
      of the words &ldquo;B-flat trombone.&rdquo; Somewhere they had attracted his notice in
      print; and somehow they were connected with Waldemar. Then from amidst the
      hundreds of advertisements with which, in the past weeks, he had crowded
      his brain, one stood out clear. It voiced the desire of an unknown
      gentleman on the near border of Harlem for the services of a performer
      upon that semi-exotic instrument. One among several, it had been cut from
      the columns of the Universal, on the evening which had launched him upon
      his new enterprise. Average Jones made two steps to a bookcase, took down
      a huge scrap-book from an alphabetized row, and turned the leaves rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three Hundred East One Hundredth Street,&rdquo; said he, slamming the book shut
      again. &ldquo;Three Hundred East One Hundredth. You won't mind, will you,&rdquo; he
      said to Waldemar, &ldquo;if I leave you unceremoniously?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recalled a forgotten engagement?&rdquo; asked the other, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. No. I mean I'm going to Harlem to hear some music. Thirty-fourth's
      the nearest station, isn't it? Thanks. So long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Waldemar rubbed his head thoughtfully as the door slammed behind the
      speeding Ad-Visor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what kind of a tune is he on the track of, I wonder?&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;I
      wish it hadn't struck him until I'd had time to go over the Linder
      business with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But while Waldemar rubbed his head in cogitatation and the Honorable
      William Linder, in his Brooklyn headquarters, breathed charily, out of
      respect to his creaking rib, Average Jones was following fate northward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three Hundred East One Hundredth Street is a house decrepit with a disease
      of the aged. Its windowed eyes are rheumy. It sags backward on gnarled
      joints. All its poor old bones creak when the winds shake it. To Average
      Jones' inquiring gaze on this summer day it opposed the secrecy of a
      senile indifference. He hesitated to pull at its bell-knob, lest by that
      act he should exert a disruptive force which might bring all the frail
      structure rattling down in ruin. When, at length, he forced himself to the
      summons, the merest ghost of a tinkle complained petulantly from within
      against his violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old lady came to the door. She was sleek and placid, round and
      comfortable. She did not seem to belong in that house at all. Average
      Jones felt as if he had cracked open one of the grisly locust shells which
      cling lifelessly to tree trunks, and had found within a plump and
      prosperous beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was an advertisement for a trombone player inserted from this house,
      ma'am?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long ago,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I too late, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much. It was answered nearly two months since. I have never,&rdquo; said the
      old lady with conviction, &ldquo;seen such a frazzled lot of folks as B-flat
      trombone players.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The person who inserted the advertisement&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has left. A month since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you tell where he went?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Left no address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name was Telford, wasn't it?&rdquo; said Average Jones strategically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might be,&rdquo; said the old lady, who had evidently formed no favorable
      impression of her ex-lodger. &ldquo;But he called himself Ransom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had a furnished room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole third floor, furnished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it let now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Part of it. The rear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take the front room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without even looking at it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a queer young man. As to price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever you choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a very queer young man. Are you a B-flat trombone player?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I collect 'em,&rdquo; said Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;References?&rdquo; said the old lady abruptly and with suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All varieties,&rdquo; replied her prospective lodger cheerfully. &ldquo;I will bring
      'em to-morrow with my grip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For five successive evenings thereafter Average Jones sat in the senile
      house, awaiting personal response to the following advertisement which he
      had inserted in the Universal:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     WANTED&mdash;B-flat trombonist.  Must
     have had experience as street player.
     Apply between 8 and 10 p. m. R&mdash;,
     300 East 100th Street.
</pre>
    <p>
      Between the ebb and flow of applicant musicians he read exhaustively upon
      the unallied subjects of trombones and high explosives, or talked with his
      landlady, who proved to be a sociable person, not disinclined to discuss
      the departed guest. &ldquo;Ransom,&rdquo; his supplanter learned, had come light and
      gone light. Two dress suit cases had sufficed to bring in all his
      belongings. He went out but little, and then, she opined with a disgustful
      sniff, for purposes strictly alcoholic. Parcels came for him occasionally.
      These were usually labeled &ldquo;Glass. Handle with care.&rdquo; Oh! there was one
      other thing. A huge, easy arm-chair from Carruthers and Company, mighty
      luxurious for an eight-dollar lodger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he take that with him?&rdquo; asked Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. After he had been here a while he had a man come in and box it up. He
      must have sent it away, but I never saw it go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was this before or after the trombone players came?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long after. It was after he had picked out his man and had him up here
      practicing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did&mdash;er&mdash;you ever&mdash;er&mdash;see this musician?&rdquo; drawled
      Average Jones in the slow tones of his peculiar excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you, yes! Talked with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was he like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a stupid old German. I always thought he was a sort of a natural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Average Jones peered out of the window. &ldquo;Is this the man, coming up
      the street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It surely is,&rdquo; said the old lady. &ldquo;Now, Mister Jones, if he commences his
      blaring and blatting and&mdash;&ldquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There'll be no more music, ma'am,&rdquo; promised the young man, laughing, as
      she went out to answer the door-bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The musician, ushered in, looked about him, an expression of bewildered
      and childish surprise on his rabbit-like face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Schlichting,&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;I come to play the B-flat trombone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to see you, Mr. Schlichting,&rdquo; said Average Jones, leading the way
      up-stairs. &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitor put his trombone down and shook his head with conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It iss the same room, yes,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;But it iss not the same gent,
      no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You expected to find Mr. Ransom here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know Mr. Ransom. I know only to play the B-flat trombone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ransom, the gentleman who employed you to play in the street in
      Brooklyn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Schlichting made large and expansive gestures. &ldquo;It iss a pleasure to
      play for such a gent,&rdquo; he said warmly. &ldquo;Two dollars a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have played often in Kennard Street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know Kennard Street. I know only to play the B-flat trombone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kennard Street. In Brooklyn. Where the fat gentleman told you to stop,
      and fell out of the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of fear overspread the worn and innocent face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't go there no more. The po-lice, they take there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you had gone there before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to play; no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to play? Are you sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The German considered painfully. &ldquo;There vass no feet in the window,&rdquo; he
      explained, brightening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon that surprising phrase Average Jones pondered. &ldquo;You were not to play
      unless there were feet the window,&rdquo; he said at length. &ldquo;Was that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The musician assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does look like a signal to show that Linder was in,&rdquo; mused the
      interrogator. &ldquo;Do you know Linder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know nothing only to play the B-flat trombone,&rdquo; repeated the
      other patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Schlichting,&rdquo; said Average Jones, &ldquo;here is a dollar. Every evening
      you must come here. Whether I am here or not, there will be a dollar for
      you. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By way of answer the German reached down and listed his instrument to his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not that,&rdquo; forbade Average Jones. &ldquo;Put it down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to play my B-flat trombone?&rdquo; asked the other, innocently hurt. &ldquo;The
      other gent he make play here always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he?&rdquo; drawled Average Jones. &ldquo;And he&mdash;er&mdash;listened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He listened from out there.&rdquo; The musician pointed to the other room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Different times,&rdquo; was the placid reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he was always in the other room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always. And I play Egypt. Like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Average Jones, as the other stretched out a hopeful hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He liked it&mdash;Egypt,&rdquo; said the German wistfully. &ldquo;He said: 'Bravo!
      Encore! Bis!' Sometimes nine, sometimes ten times over I play it, the
      chorus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then he sent you home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then sometimes something goes 'sping-g-g-g-g!' like that in the back
      room. Then he comes out and I may go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um&mdash;m,&rdquo; muttered Average Jones discontentedly. &ldquo;When did you begin
      to play in the street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After a long time. He take me away to Brooklyn and tell me, 'When you see
      the feet iss in the window you play hard!&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause. Then Average Jones asked casually:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever notice a big easy chair here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not notice nothing. I play my B-flat trombone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And there his limitations were established. But the old lady had something
      to add.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all true that he said,&rdquo; she confirmed. &ldquo;I could hear his racket in
      the front room and Mr. Ransom working in the back and then, after the old
      man was gone, Mr. Ransom sweeping up something by himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweeping? What&mdash;er&mdash;was he&mdash;er&mdash;sweeping?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glass, I think. The girl used to find little slivers of it first in one
      part of the room, then in another. I raised the rent for that and for the
      racket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next thing,&rdquo; said Average Jones, &ldquo;is to find out where that big easy
      chair went from here. Can you help me there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady shook her head. &ldquo;All I can do is to tell you the near-by
      truck men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Canvass of the local trucking industry brought to light the conveyor of
      that elegant article of furniture. It had gone, Average Jones learned, not
      to the mansion of the Honorable William Linder, as he had fondly hoped,
      but to an obscure address not far from the Navy Yard in Brooklyn. To this
      address, having looked up and gathered in the B-flat trombonist, Average
      Jones led the way. The pair lurked in the neighborhood of the ramshackle
      house watching the entrance, until toward evening, as the door opened to
      let out a tremulous wreck of a man, palsied with debauch, Schlichting
      observed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That iss him. He hass been drinking again once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones hurried the musician around the corner into concealment.
      &ldquo;You have been here before to meet Mr. Ransom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did he meet you to pay you your wages?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On some corner,&rdquo; said the other vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he took you to the big house and left you there,&rdquo; urged Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he left me on the street corner. 'When the feet iss in the window,'
      he says, 'you play.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It comes to this,&rdquo; drawled Average Jones intently, looking the employee
      between his vacuous eyes. &ldquo;Ransom shipped the chair to Plymouth Street and
      from there to Linder's house. He figured out that Linder would put it in
      his study and do his sitting at the window in it. And you were to know
      when he was there by seeing his feet in the window, and give the signal
      when you saw him. It must have been a signal to somebody pretty far off,
      or he wouldn't have chosen so loud an instrument as a B-flat trombone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can play the B-flat trombone louder as any man in the business,&rdquo;
       asserted Schlichting with proud conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what gets me,&rdquo; pursued Average Jones, &ldquo;is the purpose of the signal.
      Whom was it for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know nothing,&rdquo; said the other complacently. &ldquo;I only know to play
      the B-flat trombone louder as any man in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones paid him a lump sum, dismissed him and returned to the
      Cosmic Club, there to ponder the problem. What next? To accuse Ransom, the
      mysterious hirer of a B-flat trombone virtuosity, without sufficient proof
      upon which to base even a claim of cross-examination, would be to block
      his own game then and there, for Ransom could, and very likely would, go
      away, leaving no trace. Who was Ransom, anyway? And what relation, if any,
      did he bear to Linder?
    </p>
    <p>
      Absorbed in these considerations, he failed to notice that the club was
      filling up beyond its wont. A hand fell on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Average. Haven't seen you at a Saturday special night since you
      started your hobby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Bertram. &ldquo;What's on?&rdquo; Average Jones asked him, shaking hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Freak concert. Bellerding has trotted out part of his collection of
      mediaeval musical instruments, and some professionals are going to play
      them. Waldemar is at our table. Come and join us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Conversation at the round-table was general and lively that evening, and
      not until the port came on&mdash;the prideful club port, served only on
      special occasions and in wonderful, delicate glasses&mdash;did Average
      Jones get an opportunity to speak to Waldemar aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been looking into that Linder matter a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed. I've about given up hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spoke of an old scandal in Linder's career. What was the husband's
      name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arbuthnot, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what sort of looking man he was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I could find out from Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was his business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Government employment, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the&mdash;er&mdash;scientific line, perhaps?&rdquo; drawled Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, I believe it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-m. Suppose, now, Linder should drop out of the combination. Who would
      be the most likely nominee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marsden&mdash;the man I've been grooming for the place. A first-class,
      honorable, fearless man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's only a chance; but if I can get one dark point cleared up&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused as a curious, tingling note came from the platform where the
      musicians were tuning tip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of Bellerding's sweet dulcets,&rdquo; observed Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Performer nearest them was running a slow bass scale on a sort of
      two-stringed horse-fiddle of a strange shape. Average Jones' still
      untouched glass, almost full of the precious port, trembled and sang a
      little tentative response. Up-up-up mounted the thrilling notes, in
      crescendo force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a racking sort of tone, for all its sweetness!&rdquo; said Average Jones.
      His delicate and fragile port glass evidently shared the opinion, for,
      without further warning, it split and shivered.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;They used to show that experiment in the laboratory,&rdquo; said Bertram.
&ldquo;You must have had just the accurate amount of liquid in the glass,
Average. Move back, you lunatic, it's dripping all over you.&rdquo;

 But Average Jones sat unheeding.  The liquor dribbled down into his
lap. He kept his fascinated gaze fixed on the shattered glass. Bertram
dabbed him with a napkin.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tha&mdash;a&mdash;anks, Bertram,&rdquo; drawled the beneficiary of this
      attention. &ldquo;Doesn't matter. Excuse me. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving his surprised companions, he took hat and cane and caught a Third
      Avenue car. By the time he had reached Brooklyn Bridge he had his campaign
      mapped out. It all depended upon the opening question. Average Jones
      decided to hit out and hit quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the house near the Navy Yard he learned that his man was out. So he sat
      upon the front steps while one of the highest-priced wines in New York
      dried into his knees. Shortly before eleven a shuffling figure paused at
      the steps, feeling for a key.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Arbuthnot, otherwise Ransom?&rdquo; said Average Jones blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man's chin jerked back. His jaw dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to hire another B-flat trombonist?&rdquo; pursued the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; gasped the other. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know,&rdquo; drawled Average Jones, &ldquo;how&mdash;er-you planted the
      glass bulb&mdash;er&mdash;the sulphuric acid bulb, you know&mdash;in the
      chair that you sent&mdash;er&mdash;to the Honorable William Linder, so
      that&mdash;er&mdash;it wouldn't be shattered by anything but the middle C
      note of a B-flat trombone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man sat down weakly and bowed his face in his hands. Presently he
      looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the end of an hour's talk Arbuthnot, alias Ransom, agreed to everything
      that Average Jones proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don't promise I won't kill him later. But meantime
      it'll be some satisfaction to put him down and out politically. You can
      find me here any time you want me. You say you'll see Linder to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said Average Jones. &ldquo;'Look in the next day's papers for the
      result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Setting his telephone receiver down the Honorable William Linder lost
      himself in conjecture. He had just given an appointment to his tried and
      true, but quite impersonal enemy, Mr. Horace Waldemar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can Waldemar want of me?&rdquo; ran his thoughts. &ldquo;And who is this friend,
      Jones, that he's bringing? Jones? Jones! Jones?!&rdquo; He tried it in three
      different accents, without extracting any particular meaning therefrom.
      &ldquo;Nothing much in the political game,&rdquo; he decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with a mingling of gruffness and dignity that he greeted Mr.
      Waldemar an hour later. The introduction to Average Jones he acknowledged
      with a curt nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want a job for this young man, Waldemar?&rdquo; he grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at present, thank you,&rdquo; returned the newspaper owner. &ldquo;Mr. Jones has
      a few arguments to present to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arguments,&rdquo; repeated the Honorable William Lender contemptuously. &ldquo;What
      kind of arguments?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Political arguments. Mayoralty, to be specific. To be more specific
      still, arguments showing why you should drop out of the race.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pin-feather reformer, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The politician turned to meet Average Jones' steady gaze and mildly
      inquiring smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you&mdash;er&mdash;know anything of submarine mines, Mr. Linder?&rdquo;
       drawled the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; returned the Honorable William Linder, startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Submarine mines,&rdquo; explained the other., &ldquo;Mines in the sea, if you wish
      words of one syllable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lids of the Honorable Linder contracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're in the wrong joint,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this ain't the Naval College.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. A submarine mine is a very ingenious affair. I've recently
      been reading somewhat extensively on the subject. The main charge is some
      high explosive, usually of the dynamite type. Above it is a small jar of
      sulphuric acid. Teeth, working on levers, surround this jar. The levers
      project outside the mine. When a ship strikes the mine, one or more of the
      levers are pressed in. The teeth crush the jar. The sulphuric acid drops
      upon the main charge and explodes it. Do you follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll follow you as far as the front door,&rdquo; said the politician balefully.
      He rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the charge were in a chair, in the cushion of an easy chair, we'll
      say, on the third floor of a house in Brooklyn&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Honorable William Linder sat down again. He sat heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;the problem would be somewhat different. Of course, it would be
      easy to arrange that the first person to sit down in the chair would, by
      his own weight, blow himself up. But the first person might not be the
      right person, you know. Do you still follow me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Honorable William Linder made a remark like a fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, we have, if you will forgive my professorial method,&rdquo; continued
      Average Jones, &ldquo;a chair sent to a gentleman of prominence from an
      anonymous source. In this chair is a charge of high explosive and above it
      a glass bulb containing sulphuric acid. The bulb, we will assume, is so
      safe-guarded as to resist any ordinary shock of moving. But when this
      gentleman, sitting at ease in his chair, is noticed by a trombonist,
      placed for that purpose In the street, below&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Dutch horn-player!&rdquo; cried the politician. &ldquo;Then it was him; and I'll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only an innocent tool,&rdquo; interrupted Average Jones, in his turn. &ldquo;He had
      no comprehension of what he was doing. He didn't understand that the
      vibration from his trombone on one particular note by the slide up the
      scale&mdash;as in the chorus of Egypt&mdash;would shiver that glass and
      set off the charge. All that he knew was to play the B-flat trombone and
      take his pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His pay?&rdquo; The question leaped to the politician's lips. &ldquo;Who paid him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man&mdash;named&mdash;er&mdash;Arbuthnot,&rdquo; drawled Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Linder's eyes did not drop, but a film seemed to be drawn over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You once knew&mdash;er&mdash;a Mrs. Arbuthnot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thick shoulders quivered a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her husband&mdash;her widower&mdash;is in Brooklyn. Shall I push the
      argument any further to convince you that you'd better drop out of the
      mayoralty race?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Linder recovered himself a little. &ldquo;What kind of a game are you ringing in
      on me?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think,&rdquo; suggested Average Jones sweetly, &ldquo;that considered as
      news, this&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Linder caught the word out of his mouth. &ldquo;News!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;A fake story
      ten years old, news? That ain't news! It's spite work. Even your dirty
      paper, Waldemar, wouldn't rake that kind of muck up after ten years. It'd
      be a boomerang. You'll have to put up a stronger line of blackmail and
      bluff than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blackmail is perhaps the correct word technically,&rdquo; admitted the
      newspaper owner, &ldquo;but bluff&mdash;there you go wrong. You've forgotten one
      thing; that Arbuthnot's arrest and confession would make the whole story
      news. We stand ready to arrest Arbuthnot, and he stands ready to confess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long, tense minute of silence. Then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; The straight-to-the-point question was an admission of
      defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your announcement of withdrawal. I'd rather print that than the Arbuthnot
      story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. Finally the Honorable Linder dropped his hand on
      the table. &ldquo;You win,&rdquo; he declared curtly. &ldquo;But you'll give me the benefit,
      in the announcement, of bad health caused by the shock of the explosion,
      to explain my quitting, Waldemar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will certainly make it more plausible,&rdquo; assented the newspaper owner
      with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Linder turned on Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you dope this out, young fellow?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you've put me in the Down-and-Out-Club, all right. And I'm just
      curious enough to want to know how you did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By abstaining,&rdquo; returned Average Jones cryptically, &ldquo;from the best wine
      that ever came out of the Cosmic Club cellar.&rdquo;

    <p>
      From his inner sanctum, Average Jones stared obliquely out upon the whirl
      of Fifth Avenue, warming itself under a late March sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the outer offices a line of anxious applicants was being disposed of by
      his trained assistants. To the advertising expert's offices had come that
      day but three cases difficult enough to be referred to the Ad-Visor
      himself. Two were rather intricate financial lures which Average Jones was
      able to dispose of by a mere &ldquo;Don't.&rdquo; The third was a Spiritualist
      announcement behind which lurked a shrewd plot to entrap a senile
      millionaire into a marriage with the medium. These having been settled,
      the expert was free to muse upon a paragraph which had appeared in all the
      important New York morning papers of the day before.

     as to slayer of Brindle Bulldog &ldquo;Rags&rdquo;
      killed in office of Malcolm Dorr, Stengel
     Building, Union Square, March 29.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's too much money for a dog,&rdquo; decided Average Jones. &ldquo;Particularly
      one that hasn't any bench record. I'll just have a glance into the thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slipping on his coat he walked briskly down the avenue, and crossing over
      to Union Square, entered the gloomy old building which is the sole
      survival of the days when the Stengel estate foresaw the upward trend of
      business toward Fourteenth Street. Stepping from the elevator at the
      seventh floor, he paused underneath this sign:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                     MALCOLM DORR
          ANALYTICAL AND CONSULTING CHEMIST
                     Hours 10 to 4
</pre>
    <p>
      Entering, Average Jones found a fat young man, with mild blue eyes,
      sitting at a desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Dorr?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the fat young man nervously, &ldquo;but if you are a reporter, I
      must&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not,&rdquo; interrupted the other. &ldquo;I am an expert on advertising, and I
      want that one thousand dollars reward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chemist pushed his chair back and rubbed his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you have&mdash;have found out something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. But I intend to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dorr stared at him in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very fond of dogs, Mr. Dorr?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Oh, yes. Yes, certainly,&rdquo; said the other mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones shot a sudden glance of surprise at him, then looked
      dreamily at his own finger-nails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can sympathize with you. I have exhibited for some years. Your dog was
      perhaps a green ribboner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;oh&mdash;yes; I believe so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Several of mine have been. One in particular, took medal after medal;
      a beautiful glossy brown bulldog, with long silky ears, and the slender
      splayed-out legs that are so highly prized but so seldom seen nowadays.
      His tail, too, had the truly Willoughby curve, from his dam, who was a
      famous courser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dorr looked puzzled. &ldquo;I didn't know they used that kind of dog for
      coursing,&rdquo; he said vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones smiled with almost affectionate admiration at the crease
      along the knee of his carefully pressed trousers. His tone, when next he
      spoke, was that of a youth bored with life. Any of his intimates would
      have recognized in it, however, the characteristic evidence that his mind
      was ranging swift and far to a conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Dorr,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;who&mdash;er&mdash;owned your&mdash;er&mdash;dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I&mdash;I did,&rdquo; said the startled chemist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who gave him to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so. Was it that&mdash;er&mdash;friend who&mdash;er&mdash;offered
      the reward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, to be frank. A man who doesn't know a bulldog from a bed-spring
      isn't likely to be offering a thousand dollars to avenge the death of one.
      And the minute you answered my question as to whether you cared for dogs,
      I knew you didn't. When you fell for a green ribbon, and a splay-legged,
      curly-tailed medal-winner in the brindle bull class (there's no such
      class, by the way), I knew you were bluffing. Mr. Dorr, who&mdash;er&mdash;has
      been&mdash;er&mdash;threatening your life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chemist swung around in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. I'm guessing. It's a fair guess that a reasonably valuable
      brindle bull isn't presented to a man who cares nothing for dogs without
      some reason. The most likely reason is protection. Is it in your case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; replied the other, after some hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now the protection is gone. Don't you think you'd better let me in on
      this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me speak to my&mdash;my legal adviser first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He called up a down-town number on the telephone and asked to be connected
      with Judge Elverson. &ldquo;I may have to ask you to leave the office for a
      moment,&rdquo; he said to his caller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. But if that is United States District Attorney Roger Elverson,
      tell him that it is A. V. R. Jones who wants to know, and remind him of
      the missing letter opium advertisement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Almost immediately Average Jones was called back from the hallway, whither
      he had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elverson says to tell you the whole thing,&rdquo; said the chemist, &ldquo;in
      confidence, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understood. Now, who is it that wants to get rid of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Paragon Pressed Meat Company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones became vitally concerned in removing an infinitesimal speck
      from his left cuff. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he commented, &ldquo;the Canned Meat Trust. What have
      you been doing to them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sold them a preparation of my invention for deodorizing certain
      by-products used for manufacturing purposes. Several months ago I found
      they were using it on canned meats that had gone bad, and then selling the
      stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would the meat so treated be poisonous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;dangerous to any one eating it habitually. I wrote, warning
      them that they must stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they reply?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man came to see me and told me I was mistaken. He hinted that if I
      thought my invention was worth more than I'd received, his principals,
      would be glad to take the matter up with me. Shortly after I heard that
      the Federal authorities were going after the Trust, so I called on Mr.
      Elverson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistake Number One. Elverson is straight, but his office is fuller of
      leaks than a sieve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's probably why I found my private laboratory reeking of cyanide
      fumes a fortnight later,&rdquo; remarked Dorr dryly. &ldquo;I got to the outer air
      alive, but not much more. A week later there was an explosion in the
      laboratory. I didn't happen to be there at the time. The odd feature of
      the explosion was that I hadn't any explosive drugs in the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is this laboratory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over in Flatbush, where I live&mdash;or did live. Within a month after
      that, a friendly neighbor took a pot-shot at a man who was sneaking up
      behind me as I was going home late one night. The man shot, too, but
      missed me. I reported it to the police, and they told me to be sure and
      not let the newspapers know. Then they forgot it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones laughed. &ldquo;Of course they did. Some day New York will find
      out that 'the finest police force in the world' is the biggest sham
      outside the dime museum. Except in the case of crimes by the regular,
      advertised criminals, they're as helpless as babies. Didn't you take any
      other precautions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. I reported the attempt to Judge Elverson. He sent a secret
      service man over to live with me. Then I got a commission out in Denver.
      When I came back, about a month ago, Judge Elverson gave me the two dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Rags and Tatters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Tatters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead. By the same road as Rags.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Killed at your place in Flatbush?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Right here in this room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones became suddenly very much worried about the second button of
      his coat. Having satisfied himself of its stability, he drawled, &ldquo;Er&mdash;both
      of&mdash;er&mdash;them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Ten days apart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the spot. That is, I was here when Tatters got his death. I had gone
      to the wash-room at the farther end of the hall when Rags was poisoned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say poisoned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else could it have been? There was no wound on either of the dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there evidence of poison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pathological only. In Tatters case it was very marked. He was dozing in a
      corner near the radiator when I heard him yelp and saw him snapping at his
      belly. He ran across the room, lay down and began licking himself. Within
      fifteen minutes he began to whine. Then he stiffened out in a sort of a
      spasm. It was like strychnine poisoning. Before could get a veterinary
      here he was dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you make any examination?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I analyzed the contents of his stomach, but did not obtain positive
      results.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the other dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rags? That was the day before yesterday. We had just come over from
      Flatbush and Razs was nosing around in the corner&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it the same corner where Tatters was attacked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, near the radiator. He seemed to be interested in something there
      when I left the room. I was gone not more than two minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lock the door after you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has a special spring lock which I had put on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones crossed over and looked at the contrivance. Then his glance
      fell to a huge, old-fashioned keyhole below the new fastening. &ldquo;You didn't
      use that larger lock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I haven't for months. The key is lost, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Retracing his steps the investigator sighted the hole from the radiator,
      and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not in range,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I reached the door on my return, I heard Rags yelp. You may believe I
      got to him quickly. He was pawing wildly at his nose. I called up the
      nearest veterinary. Within ten minutes the convulsions came on. The
      veterinary was here when Rags died, which was within fifteen minutes of
      the first spasm. He didn't believe it was strychnine. Said the attacks
      were different. Whatever it was, I couldn't find any trace of it in the
      stomach. The veterinary took the body away and made a complete autopsy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he discover anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The blood was coagulated and on the upper lip he found a circle of
      small pustules. He agreed that both dogs probably swallowed something that
      was left in my office, though I don't see how it could have got there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That won't do,&rdquo; returned Average Jones positively. &ldquo;A dog doesn't cry out
      when he swallows poison, unless it's some corrosive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was no corrosive. I examined the mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the radiator?&rdquo; asked Average Jones, getting down on his knees
      beside that antiquated contrivance. &ldquo;It seems to have been the center of
      disturbance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you're thinking of fumes,&rdquo; replied the chemist. &ldquo;I tested for that. It
      isn't possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I suppose not. And yet, there's the curious feature that the fatal
      influence seems to have emanated from the corner which is the most remote
      from both windows and door. Are your windows left open at night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The windows, sometimes. The transom is kept double-bolted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they face any other windows near by?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can see for yourself that they don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no fire-escape and it's too far up for anything to come in from
      the street.&rdquo; Average examined the walls with attention and returned to the
      big keyhole, through which he peeped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ever chew gum?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chemist stared at him. &ldquo;It isn't a habit of mine to,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you wouldn't have any objection to my sending for some, in
      satisfaction of a sudden irresistible craving?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any particular brand? I'll phone the corner drug store.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any sort will suit, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the gum arrived, Average Jones, after politely offering some to his
      host, chewed up a single stick thoroughly. This he rolled out to an
      extremely tenuous consistency and spread it deftly across the unused
      keyhole, which it completely though thinly, veiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what's that for?&rdquo; inquired the chemist, eying the improvised closure
      with some contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know, exactly, yet,&rdquo; replied the deviser, cheerfully. &ldquo;But when
      queer and fatal things happen in a room and there's only one opening, it's
      just as well to keep your eye on that, no matter how small it is. Better
      still, perhaps, if you'd shift your office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fat young chemist pushed his hair back, looked out of the window, and
      then turned to Average Jones. The rather flabby lines of his face had
      abruptly hardened over the firm contour below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I'm hanged if I will,&rdquo; he said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      An amiable grin overspread Average Jones' face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got more nerve than prudence,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;But I don't say you
      aren't right. Since you're going to stick to the ship, keep your eye on
      that gum. If it lets go its hold, wire me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed young Mr. Dorr. &ldquo;Whatever your little game is, I'll
      play it. Give me your address in case you leave town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I may do. I am going to hire a press-clipping bureau on special order
      to dig through the files of the local and neighboring city newspapers for
      recent items concerning dog-poisoning cases. If our unknown has devised a
      new method of canicide, it's quite possible he may have worked it
      somewhere else, too. Good-by, and if you can't be wise, be careful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dog-poisoning seemed to Average Jones to have become a popular pastime in
      and around New York, judging from the succession of news items which
      poured in upon him from the clipping bureau. Several days were exhausted
      by false clues. Then one morning there arrived, among other data, an
      article from the Bridgeport Morning Delineator which caused the Ad-Visor
      to sit up with a jerk. It detailed the poisoning of several dogs under
      peculiar circumstances. Three hours later he was in the bustling
      Connecticut city. There he took carriage for the house of Mr. Curtis
      Fleming, whose valuable Great Dane dog had been the last victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Curtis Fleming revealed himself as an elderly, gentleman all grown to
      a point: pointed white nose, eyes that were pin-points of irascible gleam,
      and a most pointed manner of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he demanded rancidly, as his visitor was ushered in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones recognized the type. He knew of but one way to deal with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jones!&rdquo; he retorted with such astounding emphasis that the monosyllable
      fairly exploded in the other's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, well,&rdquo; said the elder man, his aspect suddenly mollified.
      &ldquo;Don't bite me. What kind of a Jones are you, and what do you want of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ordinary variety of Jones. I want to now about your dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reporter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad of it. They're no good. Had my reporters on this case. Found
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your reporters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I own the Bridgeport Delineator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good boy!&rdquo; approved the old martinet. &ldquo;Sticks to his point. Dog was out
      walking with me day before yesterday. Crossing a vacant lot on next
      square. Chased a rat. Rat ran into a heap of old timber. Dog nosed around.
      Gave a yelp and came back to me. Had spasm. Died in fifteen minutes. And
      hang me, sir,&rdquo; cried the old man, bringing his fist down on Average Jones'
      knee, &ldquo;if I see how the poison got him, for he was muzzled to the snout,
      sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Muzzled? Then&mdash;er&mdash;why do, you&mdash;er&mdash;suggest poison?&rdquo;
       drawled the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fourth dog to go the same way in the last week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All in this locality?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, all on Golden Hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any suspicions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suspicions? Certainly, young man, certainly. Look at this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones took the smutted newspaper proof which his host extended,
      and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WARNING-Residents of the Golden Hill neighborhood are earnestly cautioned
      against unguarded handling of timber about woodpiles or outbuildings until
      further notice. Danger!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When was this published?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn't published. Delineator refused it. Thought it was a case of
      insanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who offered it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Professor Moseley. Tenant of mine. Frame house on the next corner with
      old-fashioned conservatory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the dogs you speak of died since then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he give any explanation of the advertisement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Acted half-crazy when he brought it to the office, the business
      manager said. Wouldn't sign his name to the thing. Wouldn't say anything
      about it. Begged the manager to let him have the weather reports in
      advance, every day. The manager put the advertisement in type, decided not
      to it, and returned the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Weather reports, eh?&rdquo; Average Jones mused a moment. &ldquo;How long was the ad
      to run?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until the first hard frost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has there&mdash;er&mdash;been a&mdash;er&mdash;frost since?&rdquo; drawled
      Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this Moseley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know much about him. Scientific experimenter of some kind, I
      believe. Very exclusive,&rdquo; added Mr. Curtis Fleming, with a grin. &ldquo;Never
      sociated with any of us neighbors. Rent on the nail, though. Insane, too,
      I think. Writes letters to himself with nothing in them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's that?&rdquo; inquired Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other took an envelope from his pocket and handed it over. &ldquo;It got
      enclosed by mistake with the copy for the advertisement. The handwriting
      on the envelope is his own. Look inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A glance had shown Average Jones that the letter, had been mailed in New
      York on March twenty-fifth. He took out the enclosure. It was a small slip
      of paper. The date was stamped on with a rubber stamp. There was no
      writing of any kind. Near the center of the sheet were three dots. They
      seemed to have been made with red ink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're sure the address is in Professor Moseley's writing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd swear to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't follow that he mailed it to himself. In fact, I should judge
      that it was sent by someone who was particularly anxious not to have any
      specimen of his handwriting lying about for identification.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. What's your interest in all this, anyway my mysterious young
      friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two dogs in New York poisoned in something the same way as yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've got my man. He confessed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confessed?&rdquo; echoed Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Practically. I've kept the point of the story to the last. Professor
      Moseley committed suicide this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Curtis Fleming had designed to make an impression on his visitor,
      his ambition was fulfilled. Average Jones got to his feet slowly, walked
      over to the window, returned, picked up the strange proof with its message
      of suggested peril, studied it, returned to the window, and stared out
      into the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut his throat about nine o'clock this morning,&rdquo; pursued the other. &ldquo;Dead
      when they found him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind not talking to me for a minute?&rdquo; said Average Jones curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told to hold my tongue in my own house by uninvited stripling,&rdquo; cackled
      the other. &ldquo;You' re a singular young man. Have it your own way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a five minutes' silence the visitor turned from the window and
      spoke. &ldquo;There has been a deadly danger loose about here for which
      Professor Moseley felt himself responsible. He has killed himself. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I was on his trail,&rdquo; declared Mr. Curtis Fleming. &ldquo;Afraid to face
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense. I believe some human being has been killed by this thing,
      whatever it may be, and that the horror of it drove Moseley to suicide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prove it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a morning paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His host handed him the current issue of the Delineator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones studied the local page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Galvin's Alley?&rdquo; he asked presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two short blocks from here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the Golden Hill section?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Curtis Fleming took the paper. His eyes were directed to a paragraph
      telling of the death of an Italian child living in Galvin's Alley. Cause,
      convulsions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; said he, somewhat awed. &ldquo;You can reason, young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got to, reason a lot further, if I'm to get anywhere in this
      affair,&rdquo; said Average Jones with conviction. &ldquo;Do you care, to come to
      Galvin's Alley with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Together they went down the hill to a poor little house, marked by white
      crepe. The occupants were Italians who spoke some English. They said that
      four-year-old Pietro had been playing around a woodpile the afternoon
      before, when he was taken sick and came home, staggering. The doctor could
      do nothing. The little one passed from spasm into spasm, and died in an
      hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there a mark like a ring anywhere on the hand or face?&rdquo; asked Average
      Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dead child's father looked surprised. That, he said, was what the
      strange gentleman who had come that very morning asked, a queer, bent
      little gentlemen, very bald and with big eye-glasses, who was kind, and
      wept with them and gave them money to bury the &ldquo;bambino.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moseley, by the Lord Harry!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Curtis Fleming. &ldquo;But what was
      the death-agent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones shook his head. &ldquo;Too early to do more than guess. Will you
      take me to Professor Moseley's place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old house stood four-square, with a patched-up conservatory on one
      wing. In the front room they found the recluse's body decently disposed,
      with an undertaker's assistant in charge. From the greenhouse came a
      subdued hissing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; asked Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fumigating the conservatory. There was a note found near the body
      insisting on its being done. 'For safety,' it said, so I ordered it looked
      to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're in charge, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's my house. And there are no relatives so far as I know. Come and look
      at his papers. You won't find much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the old-fashioned desk was a heap of undecipherable matter,
      interspersed with dates, apparently bearing upon scientific experiments; a
      package of letters from the Denny Research Laboratories of St. Louis,
      mentioning enclosure of checks; and three self-addressed envelopes bearing
      New York postmarks, of dates respectively, March 12, March 14 and March
      20. Each contained a date-stamped sheet of paper, similar to that which
      Mr. Curtis Fleming had shown to Average Jones. The one of earliest date
      bore two red dots; the second, three red dots, and the third, two. All the
      envelopes were endorsed in Professor Moseley's handwriting; the first with
      the one word &ldquo;Filled.&rdquo; The second writing was &ldquo;Held for warmer weather.&rdquo;
       The last was inscribed &ldquo;One in poor condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of these Average Jones made careful note, as well as of the laboratory
      address. By this time the hissing of the fumigating apparatus had ceased.
      The two men went to the conservatory and gazed in upon a ruin of limp
      leaves and flaccid petals, killed by the powerful gases. Suddenly, with an
      exclamation of astonishment, the investigator stooped and lifted from the
      floor a marvel of ermine body and pale green wings. The moth, spreading
      nearly a foot, was quite dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's the mate, sir,&rdquo; said the fumigating expert, handing him another
      specimen, a trifle smaller. &ldquo;The place was crowded with all kinds of
      pretty ones. All gone where the good bugs go now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones took the pair of moths to the desk, measured them and laid
      them carefully away in a drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rest must wait,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have to send a telegram.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the interested Mr. Curtis Fleming in attendance, he went to the
      telegraph office, where he wrote out a dispatch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. A. V. R. Jones?&rdquo; said the operator. &ldquo;There's a message here for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones took the leaflet and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Found gum on floor this morning when I arrived. MALCOLM DORR.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he recalled his own blank, tore it up, and substituted the following,
      which he ordered &ldquo;rushed&rdquo;:
    </p>
    <p>
      MALCOLM DORR, STENGEL BUILDING, NEW YORY CITY:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave office immediately. Do not return until it has been fumigated
      thoroughly. Imperative. A. V. R. JONES.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Average Jones to Mr. Fleming, &ldquo;I'm going back to New York.
      If any collectors come chasing to you for luna moths, don't deal with
      them. Refer them to me, please. Here is my card.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your orders shall be obeyed,&rdquo; said the older man, his beady eyes
      twinkling. &ldquo;But why, in the name of all that's unheard of, should
      collectors come bothering me about luna moths?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because of an announcement to this effect which will appear in the next
      number of the National Science Weekly, and in coming issues of the New
      York Evening Register.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed out a rough draft of this advertisement:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;For Sale&mdash;Two largest known specimens
     of Tropaea luna, unmounted; respectively
     10 and 11 inches spread.  Also various
     other specimens from collection of late
     Gerald Moseley, of Conn.  Write for
     particulars.  Jones, Room 222 Astor
     Court Temple, New York.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about further danger here?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Fleming, as Average Jones
      bade him good-by. &ldquo;Would we better run that warning of poor Moseley's,
      after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For reply Jones pointed out the window. A late season whirl of snow
      enveloped the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;The frost. Well Mr. Mysterious Jones, I don't
      know what you're up to, but you've given me an interesting day. Let me
      know what comes of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the train back to New York, Average Jones Wrote two letters. One was to
      the Denny Research Laboratories in St. Louis, the other to the Department
      of Agriculture at Washington. On the following morning he went to Dorr's
      office. That young chemist was in a recalcitrant frame of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've done about ten dollars' worth of fumigating and a hundred dollars'
      worth of damage,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and now, I'd like to have a Missouri sign. In
      other words, I want to be shown. What did some skunk want to kill my dogs
      for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they're dead, aren't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of an accident?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The kind in which the innocent bystander gets the worst of it. You're the
      one it was meant for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. You'd probably have got it if the dog hadn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speaker examined the keyhole, then walked over to the radiator and
      looked over, under and through it minutely. &ldquo;Nothing there,&rdquo; he observed;
      and, after extending his examination to the windows, book-shelf and desk,
      added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess we might have spared the fumigation. However, the safest side is
      the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? Some new game in projective germs?&rdquo; demanded the chemist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, disinfectants will kill other things besides germs,&rdquo; returned Average
      Jones. &ldquo;Luna moths, for instance. Wait a few days and I'll have some mail
      to show you on that subject. In the meantime, have a plumber solder up
      that keyhole so tight that nothing short of dynamite can get through it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Collectors of lepidoptera rose in shoals to the printed offer of luna
      moths measuring ten and eleven inches across the wings. Letters came in
      by, every mail, responding variously with fervor, suspicion, yearning
      eagerness, and bitter skepticism to Average Jones' advertisement. All of
      these he put aside, except such as bore a New York postmark. And each day
      he compared the new names signed to the New York letters with the
      directory of occupants of the Stengel Building. Less than a week after the
      luna moth advertisement appeared, Average Jones walked into Malcolm Dorr's
      office with a twinkle in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know a man named Marcus L. Ross?&rdquo; he asked the chemist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marcus L. Ross is interested, not only in luna moths, but in the rest of
      the Moseley collection. He writes from the Delamater Apartments, where he
      lives, to tell me so. Also he has an office in this building. Likewise he
      works frequently at night. Finally, he is one of the confidential
      lobbyists of the Paragon Pressed Meat Company. Do you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin,&rdquo; replied young Mr. Dorr.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be very easy for Mr. Ross, whose office is on the floor above,
      to stop at this door on his way, down-stairs after quitting work late at
      night when the elevator had stopped running and&mdash;let us say&mdash;peep
      through the keyhole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Malcolm Dorr got up and stretched himself slowly. The sharp, clean lines
      of his face suddenly stood out again under the creasy flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what you're going to do to Mr. Ross,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I want
      to see him first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to do anything to him,&rdquo; returned Average Jones, &ldquo;because,
      in the first place, I suspect that he is far, far away, having noted,
      doubtless, the plugged keyhole and suffered a crisis of the nerves. It's
      strange how nervous your scientific murderer is. Anyway, Ross is only an
      agent. I'm going to aim higher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I expect to do three things. First, I expect to scare a peaceful
      but murderous trust multimillionaire almost out of his senses; second, I
      expect to dispatch a costly yacht to unknown seas; and third, I expect to
      raise the street selling price of the evening 'yellow' journals,
      temporarily, about one thousand per cent. What's the answer? The answer is
      'Buy to-night's papers.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      New York, that afternoon, saw something new in advertising. That it really
      was advertising was shown by the &ldquo;Adv.&rdquo; sign, large and plain, in both the
      papers which carried it. The favored journals were the only two which
      indulged in &ldquo;fudge&rdquo; editions; that is, editions with glaring red-typed
      inserts of &ldquo;special&rdquo; news. On the front page of each, stretching narrowly
      across three columns, was a device showing a tiny mapped outline in black
      marked Bridgeport, Conn., and a large skeleton draft of Manhattan Island
      showing the principal streets. From the Connecticut city downward ran a
      line of dots in red. The dots entered New York from the north, passed down
      Fourth Avenue to the south side of Union Square, turned west and
      terminated. Beneath this map was the legend, also in red:
    </p>
    <p>
      WATCH THE LINE ADVANCE IN LATER EDITIONS
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time in the records of journalism that the &ldquo;fudge&rdquo; device
      had been used in advertising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great was the rejoicing of the &ldquo;newsies&rdquo; when public curiosity made a
      &ldquo;run&rdquo; upon these papers. Greater it grew when the &ldquo;afternoon edition&rdquo;
       appeared, and with their keen business instinct, the urchins saw that they
      could run the price upward, which they promptly did, in some cases even to
      a nickel. This edition carried the same &ldquo;fudge&rdquo; advertisement, but now the
      red dots crossed over to Fifth Avenue and turned northward as far as
      Twenty-third Street. The inscription was:
    </p>
    <p>
      UPWARD AND ONWARD SEE NEXT EXTRA
    </p>
    <p>
      For the &ldquo;Night Extra&rdquo; people paid five, ten, even fifteen cents. Rumor ran
      wild. Other papers, even, look the matter up as news, and commented upon
      the meaning of the extraordinary advertisement. This time, the red-dotted
      line went as far up Fifth Ave title as Fiftieth Street. And the legend was
      ominous:
    </p>
    <p>
      WHEN I TURN, I STRIKE
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all that evening. The dotted line did not turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keen as newspaper conjecture is, it failed to connect the &ldquo;red-line maps,&rdquo;
       with the fame of which the city was raging, with an item of shipping news
      printed in the evening papers of the following day:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     CLEARED&mdash;For South American Ports, steam
     yacht Electra, New York.  Owner John M. Colwell.
</pre>
    <p>
      And not until the following morning did the papers announce that President
      Colwell, of the Canned Meat Trust, having been ordered by his physician on
      a long sea voyage to refurbish his depleted nerves, after closing his
      house on West Fifty-first Street, had sailed in his own yacht. The same
      issue carried a few lines about the &ldquo;freak ads.&rdquo; which had so
      sensationally blazed and so suddenly waned from the &ldquo;yellows.&rdquo; The opinion
      was offered that they represented the exploitation of some new brand of
      whisky which would announce itself later. But that announcement never
      came, and President Colwell sailed to far seas, and Mr. Curtis Fleming
      came to New York, keen for explanations, for he, too, had seen the &ldquo;fudge&rdquo;
       and marveled. Hence, Average Jones had him, together with young Mr. Dorr,
      at a private room luncheon at the Cosmic Club, where he offered an
      explanation and elucidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole affair,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was a problem in the connecting up of loose
      ends. At the New York terminus we had two deaths in the office of a man
      with powerful and subtle enemies, that office being practically sealed
      against intrusion except for a very large keyhole. Some deadly thing is
      introduced through that keyhole; so much is practically proven by the
      breaking out of the chewing gum with which I coated it. Probably the
      scheme was carried out in the evening when the building was nearly
      deserted. The killing influence reaches a corner far out of the direct
      line of the keyhole. Being near the radiator, that corner represents the
      attraction of warmth. Therefore, the invading force was some sentient
      creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dorr shuddered. &ldquo;Some kind of venomous snake,&rdquo; he surmised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bad guess. But a snake, however small, would have been instantly
      noticed by the dogs. Now, let's look at the Bridgeport end. Here, again,
      we have a deadly influence loosed; this time by accident. A scientific
      experimentalist is the innocent cause of the disaster. Here, too, the
      peril is somewhat dependent upon warmth, since we know, from Professor
      Moseley's agonized eagerness for a frost, that cold weather would have put
      an end to it. The cold weather fails to come. Dogs are killed. Finally a
      child falls victim, and on that child is found a circular mark, similar to
      the mark on Mr. Dorr's dog's lip. You see the striking points of analogy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean us to believe poor old Moseley a cold-blooded murderer?&rdquo;
       demanded Mr. Curtis Fleming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far from it. At worst an unhappy victim of his own carelessness in
      loosing a peril upon his neighborhood. You're forgetting a connecting
      link; the secretive red-dot communications from New York City addressed by
      Moseley to himself on behalf of some customer who ordered simply by a code
      of ink dots. He was the man I had to find. The giant luna moths helped to
      do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see where they come in at all,&rdquo; declared Dorr bluntly. &ldquo;A moth a
      foot wide couldn't crawl through a keyhole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; nor do any damage if it did. The luna is as harmless as it is lovely.
      In this case the moths weren't active agents. They were important only as
      clues&mdash;and bait. Their enormous size showed Professor Moseley's line
      of work; the selective breeding of certain forms of life to two or three
      times the normal proportions. Very well; I had to ascertain some creature
      which, if magnified several times, would be deadly, and which would still
      be capable of entering a large keyhole. Having determined that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You found what it was?&rdquo; cried Dorr.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment. Having determined that, I had still to get in touch with
      Professor Moseley's mysterious New York correspondent. I figured that he
      must be interested in Professor Moseley's particular branch of research or
      he never could have devised his murderous scheme. So I constructed the
      luna moth advertisement to draw him, and when I got a reply from Mr. Ross,
      who is a fellow-tenant of Mr. Dorr's, the chain was complete. Now, you see
      where the luna moths were useful. If I had advertised, instead of them,
      the lathrodectus, he might have suspected and refrained from answering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the lathrodectus?&rdquo; demanded both the hearers at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer Average Jones took a letter from his pocket and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      BUREAU OF ENTOMOLOGY, U. S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, WASHINGTON, D. C.,
      April 7
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. A. V. R. JONES,
    </p>
    <p>
      Astor Court Temple, New York City.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      Replying to your letter of inquiry, the only insect answering your
      specifications is a small spider Lathrodectus mactans, sometimes popularly
      called the Red Dot, from a bright red mark upon the back. Rare cases are
      known where death has been caused by the bite of this insect. Fortunately
      its fangs are so weak that they can penetrate only very tender skin,
      otherwise death from its bite would be more common, as the venom, drop for
      drop, is perhaps the most virulent known to science.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Bureau knows nothing of any experiments in breeding the Lathrodectus
      for size. Your surmise that specimens of two or three times the normal
      size would be dangerous to life is undoubtedly correct, and selected
      breeding to that end should be conducted only under adequate scientific
      safeguards. A Lathrodectus mactans with fangs large enough to penetrate
      the skin of the hand, and a double or triple supply of venom, would be,
      perhaps, more deadly than a cobra.
    </p>
    <p>
      The symptoms of poisoning by this species are spasms, similar to those of
      trismus, and agonizing general pains. There are no local symptoms, except,
      in some cases, a circle of small pustules about the bitten spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commercially, the Lathrodectus has value, in that the poison is used in
      certain affections of the heart. For details, I would refer you to the
      Denny Laboratories of St. Louis, Mo., which are purchasers of the venom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The species is very susceptible to cold, and would hardly survive a severe
      frost. It frequents woodpiles and outhouses. Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      L. O. HOWARD, Chief of Bureau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Ross was sneaking down here at night and putting the spiders which
      he had got from Professor Moseley through my keyhole, in the hope that
      sooner or later one of them would get me,&rdquo; said Dorr.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very reasonable expectation, too. Vide, the dogs,&rdquo; returned Average
      Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Mr. Curtis Fleming, &ldquo;will some one kindly explain to me
      what this Ross fiend had against our friend, Mr. Dorr?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing? Was he coursing with spiders merely for sport?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. You see Mr. Dorr was interfering with the machinery of one of our
      ruling institutions, the Canned Meat Trust. He possessed information which
      would have indicted all the officials. Therefore it was desirable&mdash;even
      essential&mdash;that he should be removed from the pathway of progress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Socialistic nonsense!&rdquo; snapped Mr. Curtis Fleming. &ldquo;Trusts may
      be unprincipled, but they don't commit individual crimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't they?&rdquo; returned Average Jones, smiling amiably at his own boot-tip.
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear of Mr. Adel Meyer's little corset steel which he
      invented to stick in the customs scales and rob the government for the
      profit of his Syrup Trust? Or of the individual oil refineries which
      mysteriously disappeared in fire and smoke at a time when they became
      annoying to the Combination Oil Trust? Or of the Traction Trust's two
      plots to murder Prosecutor Henry in San Francisco? I'm just mentioning a
      few cases from memory. Why, when a criminal trust faces only loss it will
      commit forgery, theft or arson. When it faces jail, it will commit murder
      just as determinedly. Self-defense, you know. As for the case of Mr. Dorr&mdash;&rdquo;
       and he proceeded to detail the various attempts on the young chemist's
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why so roundabout a method?&rdquo; asked Dorr skeptically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they tried the ordinary methods of murder on you through agents.
      That didn't work. It was up to the Trust to put one of its own
      confidential men on it. Ross is an amateur entomologist. He devised a
      means that looked to be pretty safe and, in the long run, sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And would have been but for your skill, young Jones,&rdquo; declared Mr. Curtis
      Fleming, with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't forget the fortunate coincidences,&rdquo; replied Average Jones modestly.
      &ldquo;They're about half of it. In fact, detective work, for all that is said
      on the other side, is mostly the ability to recognize and connect
      coincidences. The coincidence of the escape of the Red Dots from Professor
      Moseley's breeding cages; the coincidence of the death of the dogs on
      Golden Hill, followed by the death of the child; the coincidence of poor
      Moseley's having left the red dot letters on the desk instead of
      destroying them; the coincidence of Dorr's dogs being bitten, when it
      might easily have been himself had he gone to turn on the radiator and
      disturbed the savage little spider&mdash;&ldquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the chief coincidence of your having become interested in the
      advertisement which Judge Elverson had me insert, really more to scare off
      further attempts than anything else,&rdquo; put in Dorr. &ldquo;What became of the
      spiders that were slipped through my keyhole, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two of them, as you know, were probably killed by the dogs. The others
      may well have died of cold. At night when the heat was off and the windows
      open. The cleaning woman wouldn't have been likely to notice them when she
      swept the bodies out. And, sooner or later, if Ross had continued to
      insert Red Dots through the keyhole one of them would have bitten you,
      Dorr, and the Canned Meat Trust would have gone on its way rejoicing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you've certainly saved my life,&rdquo; declared Dorr, &ldquo;and it's a case of
      sheer force of reasoning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones shook his head. &ldquo;You might give some of the credit to
      Providence,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Just one little event would have meant the saving
      of the Italian child, and of Professor Moseley, and the death of yourself,
      instead of the other way around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that event?&rdquo; asked Mr. Curtis Fleming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five degrees of frost in Bridgeport,&rdquo; replied Average Jones.

      CHAPTER III. OPEN TRAIL
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not good enough,&rdquo; said Average Jones, laying aside a sheet of paper upon
      which was pasted a newspaper clipping. &ldquo;We can't afford luxuries,
      Simpson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The confidential clerk rubbed his high, pale forehead indeterminately.
      &ldquo;But five thousand dollars, Mr. Jones,&rdquo; he protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would pay a year's office rent, you're thinking. True. Nevertheless I
      can't see the missing Mr. Hoff as a sound professional proposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you think it would be impossible to find him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, why should I think any such absurd thing? I think, if you choose,
      that he wouldn't be worth the amount, when found, to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ad says different, Sir.&rdquo; Simpson raised the paper and read:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS&mdash;The aforesaid sum
     will be paid without question to anyone
     furnishing information which leads to the
     discovery of Roderick Hoff, twenty-four years
     old, who left his home in Toledo, 0., on
     April 12.  Communicate with Dr. Conrad Hoff,
     Toledo.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely Doctor Hoff is good for the amount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's good for millions, thanks to his much advertised quack
      'Catarrh-Killer.' The point is, from what I can discover, Mr. Roderick
      Hoff isn't worth retrieving at any price above one dime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the information about him that you wished, in the telegram?&rdquo; asked
      the confidential clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; all I wanted. Thanks for looking after it. Have the Toledo reporter,
      who sent it, forward his bill. And if the old inventor who's been haunted
      by disembodied voices comes again, bring him to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Simpson, going out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left to himself, Average Jones again ran over the dispatches, conveying
      the information as to the lost Toledo youth. They had given a fairly
      complete sketch of young Hoff's life and character. At twenty-four, it
      appeared, Roderick Hoff had achieved a career. Emerging, by the propulsive
      method, from college, in the first term of his freshman year, he had taken
      a post-graduate course in the cigarette ward of a polite retreat for
      nervous wrecks. He had subsequently endured two breach-of-promise suits,
      had broken the state automobile record for number of speed violation
      arrests, had been buncoed, badgered, paneled, blackmailed and short-carded
      out of sums varying between one hundred and ten thousand dollars; and now,
      in the year of grace, 19&mdash;, was the horror of the pulpit and the
      delight of the press of the city which he called his home. For the rest,
      he was a large, mild, good-humored, pulpy individual, with a fixed
      delusion that the human organism can absorb a quart of alcoholic
      miscellany per day and be none the worse for it. The major premise of his
      proposition was perfectly correct. He proved it daily. The minor premise
      was an error. Bets were even in the Toledo clubs as to whether delirium
      tremens or paresis would win the event around young Mr. Hoff's kite-shaped
      race-track of a brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his tastes the income of twenty-five thousand dollars per annum which
      his father allowed him from the profits of &ldquo;Dr. Hoff's Catarrh-Killer,&rdquo;
       proved sadly insufficient to his needs. He mentioned this fact to his
      father, so Average Jones' information ran, early in April, and suggested
      an increase, only to be refused with some acerbity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I'll go and make it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The amazement inspired in Doctor Hoff's mind by this pronouncement was
      augmented in the next few days by the fact that Roderick was very busy
      about town in his motor-car, and was changed to vivid alarm immediately
      thereafter by the young man's disappearance. To all intents and
      appearances, Roderick Hoff had dropped off the earth on or about April
      twelfth. By April fifteenth New York, Pittsburg, Chicago, Washington and
      other clearing-houses for the distribution of the unspent increment were
      apprised of the elder Hoff's five thousand-dollar anxiety through the
      medium of the daily press. This advertisement it was, upon the practical
      merits of which Average Jones and his confidential clerk had differed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there were any chance of sport in it,&rdquo; mused Average Jones, &ldquo;I'd go
      in. But to follow the trail of a spurious young sport from bar-room to
      brothel and from brothel to gambling hell&mdash;&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;Not
      good enough,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simpson's face appeared at the door. His blond forehead was wrinkled with
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Hoff is here, Mr. Jones. I told him you couldn't see him, but he
      wouldn't take no. Says he was recommended to you by a former client.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Following the word, there burst into Average Jones' private sanctum a
      gross old man, silk-hatted and bediamonded, whose side-whiskers bristled
      whitely with perturbed self-importance. In his hand was a patchy bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tried to stop me!&rdquo; he sputtered. &ldquo;Me! I'm worth ten million dollars,
      an' a ten-dollar-a-week office toad tries to hold me up when I come here
      myself person'ly, from Toledo to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Analysis of advertising in all its forms had inspired Average Jones with a
      profound contempt and dislike for the cruelest of all forms of swindling
      medical quackery. And this swollen, smug-faced intruder looked a
      particularly offensive specimen of his kind. Therefore the Ad-Visor said
      curtly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't take your case. Good day&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not take it! Did you read the reward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It is interesting as showing the patent medicine faker's touching
      confidence in the power of advertising. Otherwise it doesn't, interest me.
      Get some one else to find your young hopeful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't no case of findin' now. The boy's dead.&rdquo; His strident voice
      quavered and broke, but rose again to a snarl. &ldquo;And, by God, I'll spend a
      million to get the dogs that murdered him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the word &ldquo;murdered&rdquo; Average Jones' clean cut, agreeable, but rather
      stolidly neutral face underwent a subtle transformation. Another
      personality looked out from the deep-set, somnolent, gray eyes; a
      personality resolute, forceful and quietly alert. It was apparently belied
      by the hesitant drawl, which, as all who had ever seen the Ad-Visor at his
      chosen pursuits well knew, signified awakened or intensified interest in
      the matter in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&mdash;er&mdash;is&mdash;the&mdash;er&mdash;body&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. It ain't been found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how do you know he's dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other tore open the bundle he carried, and spread before Average Jones
      a white stained shirt with ominous brown splotches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's his shirt. There's the initials. Mailed to my house and got there
      just after I left. My secretary brought it on, with the note that come
      pinned to it. Here it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He produced a bit of coarse wrapping-paper upon which was this message in
      rough capital letters:
    </p>
    <p>
      TWO DAGOES SHOT HIM DASSENT SAY NO MORE FROM A FRIEND IN CINCINNATI.
      Average Jones examined the wrapper. It was postmarked Cincinnati. He next
      smoothed out the creased silk and studied minutely the blotches, which
      were heaviest about the left breast and shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the surprise of Doctor Hoff, the young man's glance roved the big desk
      before him, settling with satisfaction upon a sponge-cup for moistening
      stamps. Applying this to one of the spots on the shirt, he rubbed the
      wetted portion vigorously on a sheet of paper which lay near at hand. His
      lips pursed. He whistled very softly and meditatively. He scratched his
      chin with a slow movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; he shot out suddenly at the older man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All! Ain't it enough? He's been murdered; murdered, I tell you, an' you
      set there an' whistle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones directed a dreamy smile toward a far comer of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see anything so far,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;to indicate that your son is
      not alive and well at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Hoff struck his fist down heavily on the desk. &ldquo;What's this you're
      givin' me? Can't you read? Look at that note there, an' the blood on the
      shirt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you mind moderating your voice? My outside office is full of more
      or less excitable clients,&rdquo; said the Ad-Visor mildly. &ldquo;Moreover, it's not
      blood anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's beside the question. Dried blood rubs off a faint buff color.&rdquo; He
      picked up the sheet of paper from his desk. A deep brownish streak showed
      where he had applied the moistened cloth. &ldquo;It's the rawest kind of a
      blind. Why, the idiot who sent the shirt didn't even have the sense to
      fake bullet holes. Enough to make one lose all interest in the case,&rdquo; he
      added disgustedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Hoff began tugging at his side-whiskers. &ldquo;Don't do nothing like
      that,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;Come with me to Cincinnati. If he ain't dead they've
      kidnapped him for a ransom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Cincinnati is the last place on the map to look, because there's
      where they want you to think he is. But it doesn't look like a case of
      ransom to me. Let's see. Was he particularly drunk the day before he
      disappeared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He was sober.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unusually sober, maybe?&rdquo; suggested the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he was. Been sober for a week. An' he was studyin', too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Studying what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spanish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spanish, eh? Ever exhibit any interest in foreign tongues before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not enough to get him through one term in college,&rdquo; returned the other
      grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know about his studying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seen the perfessor in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one you knew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I asked him. Roddy was sore because I found out what he was up to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon that point Average Jones meditated a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see this Spanish professor again?&rdquo; he inquired presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that you speak of it, I didn't see him but the once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you leave for Toledo on to-night's train?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're goin' to take the case, then?&rdquo; the quack clawed nervously at his
      professional white whiskers. &ldquo;What's your terms?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I'm to have full control and that you're to take orders and not give
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Hoff swallowed that with a gulp. &ldquo;You're on,&rdquo; he said finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the train Doctor Hoff regaled his companion with a strictly paternal
      view of his son's character and pursuits as he knew them. This served, at
      least, to enlarge his auditor's ideas as to the average American father's
      vast and profound ignorance of the life, habits, manners and customs of
      that common but variable species, the Offspring. Beyond this it had little
      value. Average Jones gave its author a few specific instructions as to
      minor lines of home investigation, and retired to map out a tentative
      campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first call, on arriving at Toledo, was at the business office of the
      Daily Saw, in which he inserted the following paragraph on a
      repeat-until-stopped order:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     WANTED&mdash;Instructor in Spanish.  One with recent
     Experience preferred.  Apply between 9 and 10
     A.M.  Doctor Hoff, 360 Fairfield Avenue.
</pre>
    <p>
      Thence he climbed the stairs to the den of the city editor, to whom he
      stated his errand openly, being too wise in his day and generation to
      attempt concealment or evasion with a newspaper man from whom he wanted
      information. The city editor obligingly furnished further details
      regarding &ldquo;Rickey&rdquo; Hoff, as he called the young man, which, while
      differing in important respects from Doctor Hoff's, bore the ear-marks of
      superior accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst of it is,&rdquo; said the newspaper man, &ldquo;that there are elements of
      decency about the young cub, if he'd keep sober. He won't go into the old
      boy's business, because he hates it. Says it's all rot and lies. He's dead
      right, of course. But there's nothing else for him to do, so he just
      fights booze. Better make a few inquiries at Silent Charley's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quiet little bar kept by a talkative Swede. 'Rickey' Hoff hung out there
      a lot. Charley even had a room fixed up for him to lay off in when he was
      too pickled to go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would&mdash;er&mdash;young Hoff&mdash;er&mdash;perhaps keep a few&mdash;er&mdash;extra
      clothes there?&rdquo; asked Average Jones, seemingly struggling with a yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city editor stared. &ldquo;Oh, I dare say. He used to end his sprees pretty
      much mussed up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would perhaps explain where the shirt came from,&rdquo; murmured the
      Ad-Visor. &ldquo;Much obliged for the suggestion. I'll just step around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silent Charley&rdquo; he found ready, even eager to talk. Yes; &ldquo;Rickey&rdquo; Hoff
      had been in his place right along. Drunk? No; not even drinking much
      lately. Two other gentlemen had met him there quite often. They sat in the
      back room and talked. No, neither of them was Spanish. One was big and
      clean-shaven and wore a silk hat. They called him &ldquo;Colonel.&rdquo; A swell
      dresser. The other man drank gin, and a lot of it. His name was Fred. He
      was very tanned. One day there had been a hot discussion over a sheet of
      paper that lay on the table in front of the three men in the back room.
      &ldquo;Rickey&rdquo; had called a messenger boy and sent him out for a geography. &ldquo;I
      told you there wasn't any such thing there,&rdquo; the saloon-keeper heard him
      say triumphantly, when the geography arrived. Then Fred replied: &ldquo;To h-ll
      with you and your schoolbook! I tell you I've waded across it.&rdquo; The
      colonel smoothed things over and it ended in a magnum of champagne being
      ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For which the colonel paid?&rdquo; asked Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, he did,&rdquo; assented the saloon man. &ldquo;He said, 'Well, it's a go,
      then. Here's luck to us!' He was a good spender, the colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you haven't seen any of them since, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nary a one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On his return to the Hoff mansion the investigator found the head thereof
      in a state of great excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, I've found out something,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Roddy's gone to Yurrup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you find that out?&rdquo; asked Average Jones with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I been going through his papers like you told me. He's been outfitting
      for a trip. Bought lots of truck the last few days and I found the
      duplicate sale-checks that come in the packages. There's stubs for a
      steamer rug and for a dope for seasickness and for a compass,&rdquo; he
      concluded triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Compass, eh?&rdquo; observed Average Jones thoughtfully. &ldquo;Ship's compass is
      good enough for most of us going to Europe. Anything else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lot of clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of clothes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheap stuff mostly. Khaki riding-pants, neglyjee shirts and such-like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much suggestion of Europe there. What more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Hoff consulted a list. &ldquo;Colored glasses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That looks like desert travel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aneroid barometer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mountain climbing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permanganate of potash outfit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snake country,&rdquo; commented the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patent water-still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones leaned forward. &ldquo;How big?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know. Cost twenty dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little one, then. That means about three people. Taken with the compass,
      it means a small-boat trip on salt water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Small boat nothin'!&rdquo; retorted the other. &ldquo;His doctor met me this morning
      an' told me Roddy had sent for him and ast him a lot of questions about
      eatin' aboard ship and which way to have his berth made up, and all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A small-boat trip following a sea trip, then. What else have you found?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin' much. Mosquito nettin', pills, surgeon's plaster and odds and
      ends of drugs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see the drug list.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ran his eye down the paper. Then he looked at Doctor Hoff with a half
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't notice anything peculiar about this list?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know as I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the&mdash;er&mdash;nitric acid, for instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nope. What of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hoff, your son has been caught by one of the oldest tricks in the
      whole bunco list&mdash;the lost Spanish mine swindle. That acid, together
      with the rest of the outfit, means a gold-hunt as plain as if it were
      spelled out. And the Spanish professor was sent for, not to give lessons,
      but to translate the fake letter. Where does your son bank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifth National.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Telephone there and find out how much he drew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Hoff sat down at the 'phone. &ldquo;Five hundred dollars,&rdquo; he said
      presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked the other, disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Wait. He had six checks certified aggregating ten thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it isn't South America or the West Indies. He'd want, a letter of
      credit there. Must be some part of the United States, or just across the
      border. Well, we've done a good day's work, and I've got a hard evening's
      thinking before me. We might be able to head off the colonel's personally
      conducted expedition yet, if we could locate it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The evening's thinking formulated itself into a telegram to Average Jones'
      club, the Cosmic. It was one among the many distinctions of the modest
      little club in Gramercy Park, that its membership pretty well comprised
      the range of available information on any topic. Under the &ldquo;favored
      applications clause,&rdquo; a person whose knowledge of any particular subject
      was unique and authoritative, whether the topic were Esperanto or
      fistiana, went to the head of the waiting&mdash;list automatically and had
      his initiation fee remitted. Hence, Average Jones was confident of a
      helpful reply to his message of inquiry, which summed up his conclusions
      and surmises thus far:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cosmic CLUB, NEW YORK CITY:
    </p>
    <p>
      Refer following to geographical expert: Where is large, shallow, unmapped
      body of salt water in United States, or near border, surrounded by hot,
      snake-infested desert and mountainous country, reputed to contain gold?
      Spanish associations indicated. Wire details and name of best guide, if
      obtainable.
    </p>
    <p>
      A. JONES.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reply was disappointing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cyrus C. Allen absent from town. Will forward your wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;COSMIC CLUB.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well poised as Average Jones normally was, he chafed over the ensuing
      delay of four days, each of which gave the colonel's expedition just so
      much start upon its unknown course. The only relief was a call from the
      Spanish instructor who answered Jones' advertisement. He was the same who
      had served young Hoff. As the Ad-Visor surmised, his former employment had
      been merely the translation of a letter. The letter was in base Spanish,
      he said. He didn't remember much of it, but there was something about a
      lost gold mine. Yes; there was reference to a map. No; no geographical
      names were mentioned, but in several places the capital letters B. C.
      seemed to indicate a locality. He hadn't noted the date or the signature.
      That was all he could tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Hoff, who had been ramping with impatience over the man's lack of
      definite memory, now rushed to the atlas and began to study the maps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't trouble,&rdquo; said Average Jones coolly. &ldquo;You won't find it
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll find that B. C. if I have to go over every map in the geography.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you'll have to get a Spanish edition. For a guess, B. C. is Baja
      California, the Mexican peninsula of California.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jones sent a supplementary wire to this effect to Cyrus C. Allen, of the
      Cosmic Club, and within a few hours received a reply from that eminent
      cartographer, who had been located in a remote part of Connecticut:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably Laguna Salada, not on map. Seventy miles long; four to eight
      wide. Between Cocopah and Sierra Gigantica ranges. Country very wild and
      arid. Can be reached by water from Yuma, or pack train from Calexico.
      White, who has hunted there, says Captain Funcke, Calexico, best guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ALLEN.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones tossed this over to the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I figure it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your son's two friends had this all mapped out
      beforehand for him. One went west direct. He was the imbecile who stopped
      in Cincinnati and mailed you the bloody shirt to throw you off the scent.
      Meantime the colonel took Roderick around by a sea route, probably New
      York and New Orleans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'd explain the steamer rug and the seasickness,&rdquo; admitted Doctor
      Hoff; &ldquo;but I don't know what he'd want to go that long way for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simple enough, when you reckon with this colonel person as having brains
      in his head. He would foresee a hue and cry as soon as the young man
      disappeared. So he cooks up this trip to keep his prey out of touch with
      the newspapers for the few days when the news of the disappearance would
      be fresh enough to be spread abroad in the Associated Press dispatches.
      From New Orleans they'd go on west by train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I don't see is how they caught Roddy on such an old game. He's easy,
      but I didn't s'pose he was that easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To do him justice, he isn't&mdash;quite. They put it up on him rather
      cleverly. In the period of waiting to hear from the geographical expert
      I've put in some fairly hard work, going over your son's effects. And, in
      the room over Silent Charley's bar, I found a newspaper with this in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed to Doctor Hoff a thin clipping, marked &ldquo;Daily Saw, March 29&rdquo;:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     LOST&mdash;Spanish letter and map.
     Of no value except to owner, Return
     to No. 16, this office, and receive
     heartfelt thanks.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Doctor Hoff, after reading it over twice, &ldquo;that don't tell me
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? Yet it's pretty plain. The two crooks 'planted' the letter and map on
      your son. Probably slipped them into a pocket of his coat while he was
      drunk. Then they inserted their little ad, waited until he had time to
      find the letter, and casually called the advertisement to his attention.
      The rest would be easy. But I'll have something to say to my clerk, who
      failed to clip that ad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're workin' for me, now,&rdquo; half blustered, half whined the old quack.
      &ldquo;Whatche goin' to do next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pack for the night train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yuma or Calexico. Don't know which till I get a reply to two telegrams.
      I'll need five hundred dollars expense money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, you don't want much, do ye?&rdquo; snarled the quack, his avaricious soul
      in revolt at the prospect of immediate outlay. &ldquo;When I hire a man I expect
      him to pay his own expenses and send me the bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; agreed the other blandly. &ldquo;But, you see, you aren't hiring me.
      I'm doing this on spec. And I don't propose to invest anything in a
      dubious proposition, myself. It isn't too late to call it off, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do' wanta do that,&rdquo; said the other with contorted face. &ldquo;I'll get
      the five hundred here for' you in an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And about the five thousand dollars reward? I think I'd better have a
      word of writing on that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you don't trust me?&rdquo; snapped the other. &ldquo;I'm good for five
      million dollars to-morrow in this town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you are&mdash;in writing,&rdquo; agreed the other equably. &ldquo;That's why I
      want your valued signature. You see, to be quite frank, I haven't the
      fullest confidence in gentlemen in your line of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have my lawyer draw up a form of contract and mail it after you
      to-morrow,&rdquo; promised the quack with a crafty look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you wo&mdash;&rdquo; began Average Jones; but he broke off with a smile.
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he amended. &ldquo;If things work out as I figure them, that will
      do. And,&rdquo; he added, dropping into his significant drawl and looking the
      quack flatly in the eye, &ldquo;don't you&mdash;er&mdash;bank on my&mdash;er&mdash;not
      understanding your offer&mdash;and&mdash;er&mdash;you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uncomfortably pondering this reply, Doctor Hoff set about the matter of
      the expense money. Mean time a telegram came which settled the matter of
      immediate destination. It apprised Average Jones that, a fortnight
      previous, this paragraph had appeared in the paid columns of the Yuma
      Yucca:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     WANTED-Small, flat-bottomed sailboat.
     Centerboard type preferred.  Hasty,
     care this office.
</pre>
    <p>
      Average Jones bought a ticket for Yuma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disembarking at the Yuma station three days later, Average Jones blinked
      in the harsh sunlight at a small, compactly built, keen-eyed man, roughly
      dressed for the trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm Captain Funcke,&rdquo; said the stranger. His speech was gentle, slow, even
      hesitant; but there was something competent and reliable in his bearing
      which satisfied the shrewd young reader of men's characters from the
      outset. &ldquo;Your wire got me two days since and I came right up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any trace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Left here two days ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Flat-bottomed, narrow-beamed boat, sloop-rigged pretty light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know anything of the men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the big one. Calls himself Colonel Richford. Had a fake copper
      outfit in the mountains east of Alamo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you think they're headed for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably the wildest country they can find, if they want to get rid of
      young Hoff,&rdquo; said the other, who had been apprised of the main points of
      the situation. &ldquo;That would likely be the Pinto range, to the southwest of
      the Laguna. Richford knows that country a little. He was in there two
      years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would probably want to get rid of him without obvious murder;&rdquo; said
      Average Jones. &ldquo;You see, his money is in certified checks which they'd
      have to get cashed. If some one should find his body with a bullet-hole in
      it, they'd have some explaining to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody'd be likely to find it. Only about two parties a year get' down
      there. Still, somebody might trail him. And I guess old Richford is too
      foxy to do any killing when he turns the trick just as well without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose it's the Pintos, then. How do we get there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard-ash breeze,&rdquo; returned the other succinctly. &ldquo;Our rowboat is
      outfitted and waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good work!&rdquo; said Jones heartily. &ldquo;How far is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixty miles to the turn of the Laguna. There's a four-mile current to
      help. They've a scant two days' start, and we'll catch up some, for their
      boat is heavier and their sail is no good with the wind in this direction.
      If we don't catch up some,&rdquo; he added grimly, &ldquo;I wouldn't want to insure
      our young friend's life. So it's all aboard, if you're ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time since embarking upon the strange seas of advertising in
      his quest of the Adventure of Life, Average Jones now met the experience
      of grilling physical toil. All that day and all the night the two men
      swung at the oars; swung until every muscle in the young Easterner's back
      had turned to live nerve-fiber, and the flesh had begun to strip from the
      palms of his hands. Even so, the hardy captain had done most of the work.
      Aided by the current, they turned the shoulder of the Cocopah range as the
      dawn shone lurid in the east, and the captain swung the boat's head to the
      southern shore of the lake. Meantime, between spells at the oars, Average
      Jones had outlined the case in full to Funcke. He could have found no
      better coadjutor:
    </p>
    <p>
      By nature and equipment every really expert hunter and tracker is a
      detective. The subtleties of the trail sharpen both physical and mental
      sensibility. Captain Funcke was, by instinct, a student of that continuous
      logic which constitutes the science of the chase, whether the prize of
      pursuit be a mountain sheep's horns or the scholar's need of praise for
      the interpreting of some half-obliterated inscription on a pre-Hittite
      tomb. After long and silent consideration the captain gave his views.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't bunco. It's a hold-up. If Richford had wanted to stick young
      Hoff, he'd never have brought him here. There isn't 'color' enough within
      eighty miles to gild a cigar band. It looks to me like the scheme is this:
      They get him off in the mountains, out of sight of the lake, so he'll have
      no landmark to go by. Then they scare him into signing co-partnership
      papers, and make him turn over those certified checks to them. With the
      papers to show for it, they go out by Calexico and cash the checks in Los
      Angeles. They could put up the bluff that their partner was guarding the
      mine while they bought machinery and outfitted. That'd be good enough to
      cash certified checks by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that's about the way I figure it out. You spoke of Richford's being
      able to get rid of young Hoff effectually, without actual murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All he'd have to do would be to quit the boy while he was asleep. A
      tenderfoot would die of thirst over there in a short time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a tenaja they're depending on. But I doubt if they find any water
      there now. It's been an extra dry season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A tenaja?&rdquo; queried the Ad-Visor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rock-basin holding rainwater,&rdquo; explained the hunter. &ldquo;There's been no
      rainfall since August. If they find the tenaja empty they'll, have barely
      enough in the canteens they pack to get them to the next water, the Tenaja
      Poquita, around behind the mountains and across the desert into the next
      range.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the next water to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Stream of Palms. That's a day and a half on foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the space of a hundred oar-strokes Average Jones ruminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose&mdash;er&mdash;they didn't&mdash;er&mdash;find any water in the
      Tenaja Poquita, either?&rdquo; he drawled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they would be up against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there's no other water in the Pintos?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;There's a tenaja that's so high up and
      so hidden that it's only known to one other man besides me, and he's an
      Indian. It's less than an hour from the tenaja that Richford will take his
      party to. And we're sure of finding water there. It never dries up this
      early.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get me to young Hoff, then, Captain. You're in command from the moment we
      land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was broad day when the keel pushed softly into the muddy bottom of a
      long, shallow arm of the lake. Captain Funcke rose, stretched the kinks
      out of his back, and jumped ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say I'm in command?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you roll up under that mesquite and fall asleep. I'm going to cast
      about for their trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the worn-out oarsman, it seemed only a few moments later that an
      insistent grip on his shoulder aroused him. But the overhead sun, whose
      direct rays were fairly boiling the sweat out of him, harshly corrected
      this impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've found their boat,&rdquo; said Captain Funcke. &ldquo;The trail heads for the
      Pintos. They're traveling heavy. I don't believe they're twenty-four hours
      ahead of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones stumbled to his feet. &ldquo;I'm ready,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a case of travel light.&rdquo; The hunter handed over a small bag of food
      and a large canteen full of water. He himself packed a much larger load,
      including two canteens and a powerful field-glass. Taking a shotgun from
      the boat, he shouldered it, and set out at a long, easy stride.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Average Jones the memory of that day has never been wholly clear.
      Sodden with weariness, dazzled and muddled by the savage sun-glare, he
      followed, with eyes fixed, the rhythmically, monotonously moving feet of
      his leader, through an interminable desert of soft, clogging sand; a
      desert which dropped away into parched arroyos, and rose to scorched mesas
      whereon fierce cacti thrust at him with thorns and spikes; a desert dead
      and mummified in the dreadful heat; a lifeless Inferno wherein moved
      neither beast, bird nor insect. He remembers, dimly, lying as he fell,
      when the indefatigable captain called a halt, and being wakened in the
      chill breeze of evening, to see a wall of mountains blocking the advance.
      Food brought him to his normal self again, and in the crisp air of night
      he set his face to the task of climbing. Severe as this was upon his
      unaccustomed muscles, the firm rocks were still a welcome relief after the
      racking looseness of sand that interminably sank away from foothold. At
      midnight the wearied pursuers dropped down from a high plateau to a narrow
      arroyo. Here again was sand. Fortunately, this time, for in it footprints
      stood out clear, illuminated by the white moonlight. They led direct to a
      side barranca. There the pursuers found the camp. It was deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a hound on the trail, Captain Funcke cast about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's where they came in. No&mdash;yes&mdash;this is it. Confound the
      cross-tracks!.. Here one of them cuts across the ridge to the tenaja for
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!... What's this? Coyote trail? Yes, but... Trail brushed over, by
      thunder! They didn't do it carefully enough... Straight for the rocky
      mesa.... That's it! They made their sneak while Hoff was asleep, probably
      covering trail behind them, and struck out for the inside desert route to
      the Tenaja Poquita.&rdquo; He took a quick look about the camp and picked up an
      empty canteen. &ldquo;Of course, they wouldn't leave him any water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he's gone to hunt it,&rdquo; suggested Average Jones. &ldquo;Which way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't tell which way a tenderfoot will go,&rdquo; said the hunter
      philosophically. &ldquo;If he had any savvy at all he'd follow the old beaten
      track around by the arroyo to the water-hole. We'll try it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the way, Average Jones noticed his companion stop frequently to examine
      the sand for something which he evidently didn't find.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are fresh footsteps we're following, aren't they?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It isn't that. He went this way all right. But the tenaja's gone
      dry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you tell that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fresh sign of animals going this way. Must have been dry for weeks.
      Our mining friends have taken what little water there was and left young
      Hoff to die of thirst,&rdquo; said the other grimly. &ldquo;Well, that explains the
      empty canteen all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and renewed his quick progress, leaping from boulder to boulder,
      between narrowing walls of gray-white rock. Just as Average Jones was
      spent and almost ready to collapse the leader checked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above the beating of the blood in his ears, Jones heard an irregular,
      insistent scuffing sound. He crouched in silence while the captain crept
      up to a ledge and cautiously peered over, then went forward in response to
      the other's urgent beckoning. They looked down into a rock-basin of wild
      and curious beauty. To this day Average Jones remembers the luminous grace
      and splendor of a Matilija poppy, which, rooted between two boulders,
      swayed gently in the white moonlight above a figure of dread. The figure,
      naked from the waist up, huddled upon the hard-baked mud, digging madly at
      the earth. A sharp exclamation broke from Average Jones. The digger
      half-rose, turned, collapsed to his knees, and pointed with bleeding
      fingers to his open mouth, in which the tongue showed black and swollen.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went down to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, &ldquo;Rickey&rdquo; Hoff was sleeping the sleep of utter exhaustion in
      camp. Average Jones felt amply qualified to join him. But it was not in
      the Ad-Visor's character to quit an enterprise before it was wholly
      completed. So long as the two bandits were on their way to cash the young
      spendthrift's checks&mdash;Jones had heard from the victim a brief account
      of the extortion&mdash;success was not fully won.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've got to get that money back,&rdquo; he said to Captain Funcke with
      conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunter made no reply in words. He merely leaned his shotgun against
      his thigh, reached around beneath his coat and produced a forty-five
      caliber revolver. This he held out toward Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good thing to have,&rdquo; conceded the other. &ldquo;But&mdash;well, no; not in this
      case. They got the booty with a show of legality, since Hoff signed the
      copartnership agreement and turned over the checks. It was under duress
      and threats, it's true, but who's to prove that, they being two to one,
      and this being Mexico? No; they're within the law, and I've a notion that
      we can get the swag back by straight sale and barter. Provided, always, we
      can catch them in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll want to make pretty good time to the Tenaja Poquita,&rdquo; pointed out
      the captain. &ldquo;They're shy on water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On wind, too. They've traveled hard, and they can't be in the pink of
      condition. According to Hoff, they deserted him while he was taking a nap,
      about four o'clock in the afternoon. It's a fair bet they'd camp for the
      night, as you say it's an eight hour hike to the tenaja.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight, the way they'd go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;er&mdash;there's a&mdash;er&mdash;shorter way?&rdquo; drawled
      Average Jones, removing some sand from a wrinkle in his scarified and
      soiled trousers as carefully as if that were the one immediate and
      important consideration in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Across the Padre Cliffs. It cuts off about four hours, and it takes
      us almost to the secret tenaja I spoke of. We can fill up there. But it's
      not what you'd call safe, even in daylight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to a hunter, wouldn't it be well worth the risk for a record pair of
      horns&mdash;even if they were only tin horns?&rdquo; queried Average Jones
      suggestively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Funcke relaxed into a grin. He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'll we do with him?&rdquo; he asked, jerking his head toward the sleeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave him water, food and a note. Now, about this Tenaja Poquita we're
      headed for. How much water do you think there is in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there's a hundred gallons it's doing well, this dry season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones got painfully to his feet. Looking carefully over the
      scattered camp outfit, he selected from it a collapsible pail. Captain
      Funcke glanced at it with curiosity, but characteristically forebore to
      ask any questions. He himself shouldered the largest canteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This'll be enough for both until we reach the supply,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don't
      need so much water at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the tenderfoot hung upon his own shoulder, not only the smallest of
      their three canteens, but also the empty one which they had found in the
      camp. Their own third tin, almost full, they left beside Hoff, with a
      note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've a notion,&rdquo; said Jones, &ldquo;that I'll need all these receptacles for
      water in my own peculiar business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; assented the other patiently. He took one of them and the
      pail from Jones and skillfully disposed them on his own back. &ldquo;Ready?
      Hike, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two hours of the roughest kind of climbing brought them to a landslide.
      These sudden shiftings of the slopes are a frequent feature of travel in
      the Lower California mountains, often obliterating trails and costing the
      wayfarer painful and perilous search for a new path. On the Padre Cliffs,
      however, had occurred that rare phenomenon, a benevolent avalanche, piling
      up a safe and feasible embankment around the angle of an impracticable
      precipice, and thus saving an hour of the most ticklish going of the
      journey. Thanks to this dispensation, the two men reached the Tenaja
      Poquita before dawn. Scouting ahead, the captain reported no fresh trail
      except coyotes and mule deer, and not more than seventy-five gallons of
      water in the basin. Of this they both drank deeply. Then after they had
      filled all the canteens, Average Jones unfolded his scheme to the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If any one caught us at it,&rdquo; commented that experienced hunter, &ldquo;we'd be
      shot without warning. However, the water would be evaporated in a few days
      anyhow, and I'll post notices at the next watercamps. I'm with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taking turn and turn about with the pail, they bailed out the rock-basin,
      scattering the water upon the greedy sand. What little moisture remained
      in the sticky mud at the bottom they blotted up with more sand. They then
      rolled in boulders. Average Jones looked down into the hollow with
      satisfaction, and moved his full canteens into a grotto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This company,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is now open for business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At eight o'clock there was a clatter of boots upon the rocks and two men
      came staggering up the defile. Colonel Richford and his partner did not
      look to be in good repair. The colonel's face was drawn and sun-blotched.
      His companion, the &ldquo;Fred&rdquo; of Silent Charley's bar, was bloated and shaken
      with liquor. Both panted with the hard, dry, open-lipped breath of the
      first stage of thirst-exhaustion. The colonel, who was in the lead,
      checked and started upon discovering astride of a rock a pleasant visaged
      young man of a familiar American type, whose appearance was in nowise
      remarkable except as to locality. With a grunt that might have been
      greeting, but was more probably surprise, the newcomer passed the seated
      man. Captain Funcke he did not see at all. That astute hunter had dropped
      behind a boulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the brink of the tenaja the colonel stopped dead. Then with an outburst
      of flaming language, he leaped in, burrowing among the rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dry!&rdquo; he yelled, lifting a furious and appalled face to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred stood staring from Average Jones to his three canteens. There was a
      murderous look on his sinister face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got water?&rdquo; he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Colonel,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;Here's drink for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For sale,&rdquo; added Average Jones calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People don't buy water in this country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not people,&rdquo; returned Average Jones cheerfully. &ldquo;You're a
      corporation; a soulless corporation. The North Pinto Gold Mining Company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that!&rdquo; cried the colonel thickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand flew back to his belt. Then it dropped, limp at his side, for he
      was gazing into the two barrels of a shotgun, which, materializing over a
      rock, were pointing accurately and disconcertingly at the pit of his
      stomach. From behind the gun Captain Funcke's quiet voice remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't, Colonel. As for you,&rdquo; he added, turning to the other
      wayfarer, who carried a rifle, &ldquo;you want to remember that a shotgun has
      two barrels, usually both loaded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stepping forward, Average Jones &ldquo;lifted&rdquo; the financier's weapon. Then he
      deprived Fred of his rifle amid a surprisingly brilliant outburst of
      verbal pyrotechnics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we can talk business comfortably,&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't talk at all pretty quick if I don't git a moistener,&rdquo; said Fred
      piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pouring out a scant cupful of water into his hat, Average Jones handed it
      over. &ldquo;Drink slowly,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;You've got about a hundred dollars'
      worth there at present quotations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Richford's head went up with a jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hundred dollars' worth!&rdquo; he croaked, his eyes fiery with suspicion. &ldquo;Are
      you going to hold up two men dying of thirst?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's been only one man in danger of that death around here. His name
      is Hoff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The redoubtable colonel gasped, and leaned back against a rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be relieved to learn that he's safe. Now, to answer your question:
      No, I don't propose to hold up two men for anything. I propose to deal
      with the president and treasurer of the North Pinto Gold Mining Company.
      As a practical mining man you will appreciate the absolute necessity of
      water in your operations. The nearest available supply is some ten hours
      distant. Before you could reach it I fear that&mdash;er&mdash;your company
      would&mdash;er&mdash;have gone out of existence. Therefore I am fortunate
      in being able to offer you a small supply which I will put on the market
      at the low rate of ten thousand dollars. I may add that&mdash;er&mdash;certified
      checks will&mdash;er&mdash;be accepted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For two hours the colonel, with the occasional objurgatory assistance of
      his partner, talked, begged argued, threatened, and even wept. By the end
      of that time his tongue was making sounds like a muffled castanet, and his
      resolution was scorched out of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got us,&rdquo; he croaked. &ldquo;Here's your checks. Give me the water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In proper and legal form, please,&rdquo; said Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      He produced a contract and a fountain-pen. The contract was duly signed
      and witnessed. It provided for the transfer of the water, in consideration
      of one revolver and ten thousand dollars in checks. These checks were
      endorsed over to A. V. R. E. Jones, whereupon he turned over the pail of
      water and the largest canteen to the parched miners. Then, sorting out the
      checks, he pocketed two aggregating five thousand dollars, tore up three,
      and holding the other in his hand, turned to Captain Funcke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will five hundred dollars pay you for keeping young Hoff down here a
      couple of months and making the beginning of a man of him?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and more,&rdquo; replied the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a go,&rdquo; said Average Jones. &ldquo;I'd like to make the job complete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, courteously bidding the North Pinto Gold Mining Company farewell,
      the two water-dealers clambered up the rocks and disappeared beyond the
      abrupt sky-line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again Doctor Conrad Hoff sat in the private office of Average Jones,
      Ad-Visor. The young man was thinner, browner and harder of fiber than the
      Jones of two weeks previous. Doctor Hoff looked him over with shrewd eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, your trip ain't done you no harm, has it?&rdquo; he exclaimed with a
      boisterous and false good nature. &ldquo;You look like' a fightin'-cock. Hope
      the boy comes out as good. You say he's all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got his letter, in which he says so himself. That's enough proof,
      isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I've got the letter all right. An' it's enough as far as it goes. But
      it ain't proof; not the kind of proof a man pays out reward money on,&rdquo; he
      added, cunningly. &ldquo;You say you left Roddy down there with that Funcke
      feller, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It'll make a man of him, if anything will. I threw that in as an
      extra.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but what about them two crooks that goldbricked him? What's become
      of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On their way to Alaska or Bolivia or Corea, or anywhere else, for all I
      know&mdash;or care,&rdquo; said Average Jones indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; The quack's voice had taken on a sneering intonation. &ldquo;You
      come back here with your job not half done, with the guilty fellers loose
      an' runnin', an' you expect me to pay over, the five thousand dollars to
      you. Huh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&mdash;er&mdash;don't expect&mdash;er&mdash;anything of the sort,&rdquo;
       said Average Jones slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Hoff's little, restless eyes puckered at the corners. He was
      puzzled. What did the young fellow mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't, eh?&rdquo; he said, groping in his mind for a solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You forgot to send me that promised form of agreement, didn't you?
      Thought you'd fooled me, perhaps. Well, I wouldn't be so foolish as to
      expect anything in the way of fair and honorable dealing when I contract
      to do up a mining swindler for the benefit of the only meaner creature on
      God's earth&mdash;a patent medicine poisoner. So I took precautions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, be careful of what you say, young man,&rdquo; blustered the quack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am&mdash;quite particular. And, before you leave, wouldn't you like to
      hear about the five thousand dollars I got for my little job?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Hoff blinked rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What didje say?&rdquo; he finally inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five&mdash;er&mdash;thousand&mdash;er&mdash;dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where dje get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From you, through your son's check, duly certified.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Hoff blinked more rapidly and moistened his lips with an effortful
      tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-h-how dje work it?&rdquo; he asked in a die-away voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By a forced sale of water rights to the North Pinto Gold Mining Company,
      dissolved, in which Mr. Roderick Hoff was vice-president and silent
      partner,&rdquo; replied Average Jones with an amiable smile, as he opened the
      door significantly.

      CHAPTER IV. THE MERCY SIGN-ONE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want a job, Average?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram, his elegance undimmed by the first really trying weather of the
      early summer, drifted to the coolest spot in the Ad-Visor's sanctum and
      spread his languid length along a wicker settee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give a man breathing space, can't you?&rdquo; returned Average Jones. &ldquo;This is
      hotter than Baja California.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I assumed that your quest of the quack's scion would have trained
      you down fit for anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't even caught up with the clippings that Simpson floods me with,
      since I came back,&rdquo; confessed the other. &ldquo;What have you got up your
      faultlessly creased sleeve? It's got to be something different to rouse me
      from a well-earned lethargy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because a man buncoes a loving father out of five thousand dollars,&rdquo;
       Average Jones snorted gently, &ldquo;is no reason why he should unanimously
      elect himself a life member of the Sons of Idleness,&rdquo;' murmured Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cast an eye around the uniquely decorated walls, upon which hung, here,
      the shrieking prospectus of a mythical gold-mine; there a small but
      venomous political placard, and on all sides examples of the uncouth or
      unusual in paid print; exploitations of grotesque quackeries; appeals,
      business-like, absurd, or even passionate, in the form of &ldquo;Wants;&rdquo; threats
      thinly disguised as &ldquo;Personals;&rdquo;' dim suggestions of crime, of fraud, of
      hope, of tragedy, of mania, all decorated with the stars of &ldquo;paid matter&rdquo;
       or designated by the Adv. sign, and each representing some case brought to
      A. Jones, Ad-Visor&mdash;to quote his hybrid and expressive doorplate&mdash;by
      some one of his numerous and incongruous clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something different?&rdquo; repeated the visitor, reverting to Average Jones'
      last observation. &ldquo;Well, yes; I think so. Where is Bellair Street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask a directory. How should I know?&rdquo; retorted the other lazily. &ldquo;Sounds
      like old Greenwich Village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram reached over with a cane of some pale, translucent green wood,
      selected to match his pale green tie and the marvelous green opal which
      held it in place, and prodded his friend severely in the ribs. &ldquo;Double-up
      Lucy; the sun is in the sky!&rdquo; he proclaimed with unwonted energy. &ldquo;Listen.
      I cut this out of yesterday's Evening Register. With my own fair hands I
      did it, to rouse you from your shameless sloth. With your kind attention,
      ladies and gentlemen&mdash;&rdquo; He read:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;WANTED&mdash;A young man, unattached,
     competent to act as assistant in
     outdoor scientific work.  Manual
     skill as desirable as experience.
     Emolument for one month's work generous.
     Man without family insisted upon.
     Apply after 8:30 P. M. in proper person.
     Smith, 74 Bellair Street.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Slowly whirling in his chair, Average Jones held out a hand, received the
      clipping, read it through with attention, laid it on the desk, and yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; said the indignant Bertram. &ldquo;Do you notice that
      'unattached' in the opening sentence? And the specification that the
      applicant must be without family? Doesn't that inspire any notion above a
      yawn in your palsied processes of mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does; several notions. I yawned,&rdquo; explained Average Jones with
      dignity, &ldquo;because I perceive with pain that I shall have to go to work.
      What do you make of the thing, yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this man Smith&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What man Smith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smith, of 74 Bellair Street, who signs the ad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones laughed, &ldquo;There isn't any Smith,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know about it?&rdquo; demanded Bertram, sitting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only what the advertisement tells me. It was written by a foreigner;
      that's too obvious for argument. 'Emolument generous.' 'Apply in proper
      person.' Did a Smith ever write that? No. A Borgrevsky might have, or a
      Greiffenhauser, or even a Mavronovoupoulos. But never Smith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's nothing to me what his name is. Only I thought you might be
      the aspiring young scientist he was yearning for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't wonder if I were, thank you. Let's see. Bellair Street? Where's
      the directory? Thanks. Yes, it is Greenwich Village. Well, I think I'll
      just stroll down that way and have a look after dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that Mr. Adrian Van Reypen Egerton Jones found himself on a
      hot May evening pursuing the Adventure of Life into the vestibule of a
      rather dingy old house which had once been the abode of solemn prosperity
      if not actual aristocracy in the olden days of New York City. Almost
      immediately the telegraphic click of the lock apprised him that he might
      enter, and as he stepped into the hallway the door of the right-hand
      ground-floor apartment opened to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will please come in,&rdquo; said a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone was gentle and measured. Also it was, by its accent, alien to any
      rightful Smith. The visitor stepped into a passageway which was dim until
      he entered it and the door swung behind him. Then it became pitch black.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will pardon this,&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;A severe affection of the eyes
      compels me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Mr. Smith?&rdquo; asked Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Your hand if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitor, groping, brushed with his fingers the back of a hand which
      felt strangely hot and pulpy. Immediately the hand turned and closed, and
      he was led forward to an inner room and seated in a chair. The gentle, hot
      clasp relaxed and left his wrist free. A door facing him, if his ears
      could be trusted, opened and shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find matches at your elbow,&rdquo; said the voice, coming dulled, from
      a further apartment. &ldquo;Doubtless you would be more comfortable with a
      light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; returned Average Jones, enormously entertained by the
      dime-novel setting which his host had provided for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lighted the gas and looked about a sparsely furnished room without a
      single distinguishing feature, unless a high and odd-shaped traveling-bag
      which stood on a chair near by could be so regarded. The voice interrupted
      his survey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come in answer to my advertisement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, then, of scientific pursuit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of scientific ambition, at least. I hope to meet your requirements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jones; A. Jones, of New York City.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You live with your family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no family or near relatives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well. I will not conceal from, you that there are risks. But the
      pay is high. Can you endure exposure? Laboring in all weathers? Subsisting
      on rough fare and sleeping as you may?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have camped in the northern forests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; mused the voice. &ldquo;You look hardy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones arose. &ldquo;You&mdash;er&mdash;are spying upon me, then,&rdquo; he
      drawled quietly. &ldquo;I might have&mdash;er&mdash;suspected a peep-hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He advanced slowly toward the door whence the voice came. A chair blocked
      his way. Without lowering his gaze he shoved at the obstacle with his
      foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a care!&rdquo; warned the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chair toppled and overturned. From it fell, with a light shock, the
      strange valise, which, striking the floor, flew open, disclosing a small
      cardboard cabinet. Across the front of the cabinet was a strip of white
      paper labeled in handwriting, each letter being individual, with what
      looked to the young man like the word &ldquo;MERCY.&rdquo; He stooped to replace the
      bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not touch it,&rdquo; ordered the voice peremptorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones straightened up to face the door again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will apologize for my clumsiness,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;when you explain
      why you have tried to trick me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently,&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;Meantime, after what you have accidentally
      seen, you will perhaps appreciate that the employment is not without its
      peril!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones stared from the door to the floored cabinet and back again
      in stupefaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I'm stupid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but a misshapen valise containing a
      cabinet with a girl's name on it doesn't seem calculated to scare an
      able-bodied man to death. It isn't full of dynamite, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your branch of scientific work?&rdquo; counter-questioned the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Botany,&rdquo; replied the young man, at random.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No other? Physics? Entomology? Astronomy? Chemistry? Biology?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The applicant shook his head in repeated negation. &ldquo;None that I've
      specialized on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I fear you will not suit my purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. But you haven't explained, yet, why you've been studying me
      through a peep-hole, when I am not allowed to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a pause of consideration the voice spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. Since I can not employ you, I owe you every courtesy for
      having put you to this trouble. You will observe that I am not very
      presentable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The side door swung open. In the dimness of the half-disclosed apartment
      Average Jones saw a man huddled in a chair. He wore a black skull cap. So
      far as identification went he was safe. His whole face was grotesquely
      blotched and swollen. So, also, were the hands which rested on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will pardon me,&rdquo; said Average Jones, &ldquo;but I am by nature cautious.
      You have touched me. Is it contagious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A contortion of the features, probably indicating a smile, made the
      changeling face more hideous than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be at peace,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is not. You can find your way out? I bid you
      good evening, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I wonder,&rdquo; mused Average Jones, as he jolted on the rear platform of
      an Eighth Avenue car, &ldquo;by what lead I could have landed that job. I rather
      think I've missed something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All that night, and recurrently on many nights thereafter, the poisoned
      and contorted face and the scrawled &ldquo;MERCY&rdquo; on the cabinet lurked
      troublously in his mind. Nor did Bertram cease to scoff him for his
      maladroitness until both of them temporarily forgot the strange &ldquo;Smith&rdquo;
       and his advertisement in the entrancement of a chase which led them for a
      time far back through the centuries to a climax that might well have cost
      Average Jones his life. They had returned from Baltimore and the society
      of the Man who spoke Latin a few days when Bertram, at the club, called up
      Average Jones' office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sending Professor Paul Gehren to you,&rdquo; was his message. &ldquo;He'll call
      to-day or to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones knew Professor Gehren by sight, knew of him further by
      repute as an impulsive, violent, warm-hearted and learned pundit who, for
      a typically meager recompense, furnished sundry classes of young gentlemen
      with amusement, alarm and instruction, in about equal parts, through the
      medium of lectures at the Metropolitan University. During vacations the
      professor pursued, with some degree of passion, experiments which added
      luster and selected portions of the alphabet to his name. Twice a week he
      walked down-town to the Cosmic Club, where he was wont to dine and express
      destructive and anarchistic views upon the nature, conduct, motives and
      personality of the organization's governing committees.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day following Bertram's telephone, Professor Gehren entered Astor
      Court Temple, took the elevator to the ninth floor, and, following
      directions, found himself scanning a ground-glass window flaunting the
      capitalized and gilded legend,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. JONES, AD-VISOR
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ad-Visor,&rdquo; commented the professor, rancorously. &ldquo;A vicious verbal
      monstrosity!&rdquo; He read on:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     ADVICE UPON ADVERTISING IN ALL FORMS
     Consultation Free. Step In
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consultation free!&rdquo; repeated the educator with virulence. &ldquo;A trap! A
      manifest pitfall! I don't know why Mr. Bertram should have sent me hither.
      The enterprise is patently quack,&rdquo; he asseverated in a rising voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the word a young man opened the door and, emerging, received the
      accusation full in the face. The young man smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quack, I said,&rdquo; repeated the exasperated mentor, &ldquo;and I repeat it.
      Quack!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you're suffering from the delusion that you're a duck,&rdquo; observed the
      young man mildly, &ldquo;you'll find a taxidermist on the top floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The caller turned purple. &ldquo;If you are Mr. Jones, of the Cosmic Club&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;there are certain things which Mr. Bertram must explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Bertram said that you were coming, but I'd almost given you up. Come
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into a&mdash;a den where free advice is offered? Of all the patent and
      infernal rascalities, sir, the offer of free advice&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; soothed the younger man. &ldquo;I know all about the free
      swindles. This isn't one of them. It's just a fad of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the perturbed scholar inside and got him settled in a chair. &ldquo;Now,
      go ahead. Show me the advertisement and tell me how much you lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've lost my assistant. There is no advertisement about it. What I came
      for is advice. But upon seeing your tricky door-plate&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's merely to encourage the timorous. Who is this assistant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harvey Craig, a youth, hardly more than a boy, for whom I feel a certain
      responsibility, as his deceased parents left him in my care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jones as the professor paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has disappeared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permanently, since ten days ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permanently?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up to that time he had absented himself without reporting to me for only
      three or four days at a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lived with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He had been aiding me in certain investigations at my laboratory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what line?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Metallurgy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did he stop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About four weeks ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he give any reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He requested indefinite leave. Work had been offered him, he hinted, at a
      very high rate of remuneration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know by whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I know nothing whatever about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any definite suspicions as to his absence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gravely fear that the boy has made away with himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After his first absence I called to see him at his room. He had obviously
      undergone a violent paroxysm of grief or shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told you this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But his eyes, and, indeed, his whole face, were abnormally swollen,
      as with weeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes.&rdquo; Average Jones' voice had suddenly taken on a bored
      indifference. &ldquo;Were&mdash;er&mdash;his hands, also?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His hands? Why should they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, why, indeed? You noted them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he seem depressed or morose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can not say that he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Professor Gehren, what, newspaper do you take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The scholar stared. &ldquo;The Citizen in the morning, The Register in the
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are either of them delivered to your laboratory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the Register.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you keep it on file?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! That's a pity. Then you wouldn't know if one were missing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor reflected. &ldquo;Yes, there was a copy containing a letter upon
      Von Studeborg's recent experiments&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you recall the date?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the middle of June, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones sent for a file and handed it to Professor Gehren.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this it?&rdquo; he asked, indicating the copy of June 18.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the letter!&rdquo; said that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones turned the paper and found, upon an inside page, the strange
      advertisement from 74 Bellair Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One more question, Professor,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;When did you last see Mr.
      Craig?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine or ten days ago. I think it was July 2.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he impress you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As being somewhat preoccupied. Otherwise normal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was his face swollen then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first time at my laboratory, about eleven o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw him again that day, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. We met by accident at a little before two P.M. on Twenty-third
      Street. I was surprised, because he had told me he had to catch a noon
      train and return to his work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he hadn't done so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He explained that he had, but that he had been sent back to buy some
      supplies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believe he was telling the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an extensive experience with young men I have never known a more
      truthful one than he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between the first day of his coming back to New York and the last, had
      you seen him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had talked with him over the telephone. He called up two or three times
      to say that he was well and working hard and that he hoped to be back in a
      few weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did he call up from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As he did not volunteer the information, I am unable to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunate again. Well, I think you may drop the notion of suicide. If
      anything of importance occurs, please notify me at once. Otherwise, I'll
      send you word when I have made progress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having dismissed the anxious pundit, Average Jones, so immersed in thought
      as to be oblivious to outer things, made his way to the Cosmic Club in a
      series of caroms from indignant pedestrian to indignant pedestrian. There,
      as he had foreseen, he found Robert Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I detach you from your usual bridge game this evening?&rdquo; he demanded
      of that languid gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very possibly. What's the inducement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chapter Second of the Bellair Street advertisement. I've told you the
      first chapter. You've been the god-outside-the-machine so far. Now, come
      on in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Together they went to the Greenwich Village house. The name &ldquo;Smith&rdquo; had
      disappeared from the vestibule.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I expected,&rdquo; said Jones. &ldquo;Our hope be in the landlord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The landlord turned out to be a German landlady, who knew little
      concerning her late ground-floor tenant and evinced no interest in the
      subject. The &ldquo;perfessor,&rdquo; as she termed &ldquo;Smith,&rdquo; had taken the flat by the
      month, was prompt in payment, quiet in habit, given to long and frequent
      absences; had been there hardly at all in the last few weeks. Where had he
      moved to? Hummel only knew! He had left no address. Where did his
      furniture go? Nowhere; he'd left it behind. Was any one in the house
      acquainted with him? Mrs. Marron in the other ground-floor flat had tried
      to be. Not much luck, she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Marron was voluble, ignorant, and a willing source of information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The perfessor? Sure! I knew'm. 'Twas me give'm the name. He was a Mejum.
      Naw! Not for money. Too swell for that. But a real-thing Mejum. A big one;
      one of the kind it comes to, nacheral. Spirit-rappin's! Somethin' fierce!
      My kitchen window is on the air-shaft. So's his. Many's the time in the
      still evenin's I've heard the rap-rap-rappin' on his window an' on the
      wall, but mostly on the window. Blip! out of the dark. It'd make you just
      hop! And him sittin' quiet and peaceful in the front room all the time.
      Yep; my little girl seen him there while I was hearin' the raps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ask him about them?&rdquo; inquired Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! He wouldn't have it at first. Then he kinder smiled and half owned
      up. And once I seen him with his materializin' wand, sittin' in the room
      almost dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Materializin' wand. Spirit-rod, you know. As tall as himself and all
      shiny and slick. It was slim and sort o' knobby like this wood&mdash;what's
      the name of it, now?&mdash;they make fish poles out of. Only the real
      big-bugs in spiritualism use 'em. They're dangerous. You wouldn't caich me
      touchin' it or goin' in there even now. I says to Mrs. Kraus, I says&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so the stream of high-pitched, eager talk flowed until the two men
      escaped from it into the vacant apartment. This was much as Average Jones
      had seen on his former visit. Only the strange valise was missing. Going
      to the kitchen, which he opened through intermediate doors on a straight
      line with the front room, Average Jones inspected the window. The glass
      was thickly marked with faint, bluish blurs, being, indeed, almost opaque
      from them in the middle of the upper pane. There was nothing indicative
      below the window, unless it were a considerable amount of crumbled putty,
      which he fingered with puzzled curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the front room a mass of papers had been half burned. Some of them were
      local journals, mostly the Evening Register. A few were publications in
      the Arabic text.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oriental newspapers,&rdquo; remarked Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones picked them up and began to fold them. From between two
      sheets fluttered a very small bit of paper, narrow and half curled, as if
      from the drying of mucilage. He lifted and read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are again, Bert,&rdquo; he remarked in his most casual tone. &ldquo;The
      quality of this Mercy is strained, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men bent over the slip, studying it. The word was, as Average
      Jones had said, in a strained, effortful handwriting, and each letter
      stood distinct. These were the characters:
    </p>
    <p>
      MERCY
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it mathematical, do you think, possibly?&rdquo; asked Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All alone by itself like that? Rather not! More like a label, if you ask
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little sister of the label on the cabinet, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cherchez la femme,&rdquo; observed Bertram. &ldquo;It sounds like perfect foolishness
      to me; a swollen faced outlander who rules familiar spirits with a wand,
      and, between investigations in the realms of science, writes a girl's name
      all over the place like a lovesick school-boy! Is Mercy his
      spirit-control, do you suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let's get out of here,&rdquo; said Average Jones. &ldquo;I'm getting dizzy with
      it all. The next step,&rdquo; he observed, as they walked slowly up the street,
      &ldquo;is by train. Want to take a short trip to-morrow, Bert? Or, perhaps,
      several short trips?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whither away, fair youth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the place where the fake 'Smith' and the lost Craig have been doing
      their little stunts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you said Professor Gehren couldn't tell you where Craig had
      gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more he could. So I've got to find out for myself. Here's the way I
      figure it out: The two men have been engaged in some out-of-door work that
      is extra hazardous. So much we know. Harvey Craig has, I'm afraid,
      succumbed to it. Otherwise he'd have sent some word to Professor Gehren.
      He may be dead or he may only be disabled by the dangerous character of
      the work, whatever it was. In any case our mysterious foreign friend has
      probably skipped out hastily. Now, I propose to find the railroad station
      they passed through, coming and going, and interview the ticket agent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got a fine large contract on your hands to find it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so large, either. All we have to do is to look for a place that is
      very isolated and yet quite near New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know it is quite near New York?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because Harvey Craig went there and back between noon and two o'clock,
      Professor Gehren says. Now, we've got to find such a place which is near a
      stretch of deserted, swampy ground, very badly infested with mosquitoes.
      I'd thought of the Hackensack Meadows, just across the river in Jersey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all very well,&rdquo; said Bertram; &ldquo;but why mosquitoes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the poisoned and swollen face and hands both of them suffered from,&rdquo;
       explained Average Jones. &ldquo;What else could it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd thought of poison-ivy or some kind of plant they'd been grubbing at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So had I. But I happened to think that anything of that sort, if it had
      poisoned them once, would keep on poisoning them, while mosquitoes they
      could protect themselves against, if they didn't become immune, as they
      most likely would. As there must have been a lot of 'skeeters' to do the
      kind of job that 'Smith's' face showed, I naturally figured on a swamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Average,&rdquo; said Bertram solemnly, &ldquo;there are times when I conceive a sort
      of respect for your commonplace and plodding intellect. Now, let me have
      my little inning. I used to commute&mdash;on the Jersey and Delaware Short
      Line. There's a station on that line, Pearlington by name, that's a
      combination of Mosquitoville, Lonesomehurst and Nutting Doon. It's in the
      mathematical center of the ghastliest marsh anywhere between Here and
      Somewhere else. I think that's our little summer resort, and I'm yours for
      the nine A. M. train to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dismounting from that rather casual accommodation on the following day,
      the two friends found Pearlington to consist of a windowed packing-box
      inhabited by a hermit in a brass-buttoned blue. This lonely official
      readily identified the subjects of Average Jones' inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I know your friends, all right. The dago was tall and thin and
      had white hair; almost snow-white. No, he wasn't old, neither. He talked
      very soft and slow. Used to stay off in the reeds three and four days at a
      time. No, ain't seen him for near a week; him nor his boat nor the young
      fellow that was with him. Sort of bugologists, or something, wasn't they.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any idea where we could find their camp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The railroad man laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine chance you got of finding anything in that swamp. There's ten square
      miles of it, every square just like every other square, and a hundred
      little islands, and a thousand creeks and rivers winding through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right,&rdquo; agreed Average Jones. &ldquo;It would take a month to search it.
      You spoke of a boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's my notion they must have had a houseboat. They could a-rowed it up
      on the tide from the Kills&mdash;a little one. I never saw no tent with
      'em. And they had to have something over their heads. The boat I seen 'em
      have was a rowboat. I s'pose they used it to go back and forth in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Average Jones. &ldquo;That's a good idea about the houseboat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the following day this advertisement appeared in the newspapers of
      several shore towns along the New Jersey and Staten Island coast.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     A DRIFT&mdash;A small houseboat lost several
     days ago from the Hackensack Meadows.
     Fifty dollars reward paid for information
     leading to recovery. Jones, Ad-Visor,
     Astor Court Temple, New York.
</pre>
    <p>
      Two days later came a reply, locating the lost craft at Bayonne. Average
      Jones went thither and identified it. Within its single room was uttermost
      confusion, testifying to the simplest kind of housekeeping sharply
      terminated. Attempt had been made to burn the boat before it was given to
      wind and current, but certain evidences of charred wood, and the fact of a
      succession of furious thunder-showers in the week past, suggested the
      reason for failure. In a heap of rubbish, where the fire had apparently
      started, Average Jones found, first, a Washington newspaper, which he
      pocketed; next, with a swelling heart, the wreck of the pasteboard
      cabinet, but no sign of the strange valise which had held it. The &ldquo;Mercy&rdquo;
       sign was gone from the cabinet, its place being supplied by a placard,
      larger, in a different handwriting, and startlingly more specific:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DANGER! IF FOUND DESTROY AT ONCE. Do Not Touch With Bare Hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing else. Gingerly, Average Jones detached the sign. The
      cabinet proved to be empty. He pushed a rock into it, lifted it on the end
      of a stick and dropped it overboard. One after another eight little fishes
      glinted up through the water, turned their white bellies to the sunlight
      and bobbed, motionless. The investigator hastily threw away the label and
      cast his gloves after it. But on his return to the city he was able to
      give a reproduction of the writing to Professor Gehren which convinced
      that anxious scholar that Harvey Craig had been alive and able to write
      not long before the time when the houseboat was set adrift.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. THE MERCY SIGN&mdash;TWO
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some days after the recovery of the houseboat, Average Jones sat at
      breakfast, according to his custom, in the cafe of the Hotel Palatia.
      Several matters were troubling his normally serene mind. First of these
      was the loss of the trail which should have led to Harvey Craig. Second,
      as a minor issue, the Oriental papers found in the deserted Bellair Street
      apartment had been proved, by translation, to consist mainly of
      revolutionary sound and fury, signifying, to the person most concerned,
      nothing. As for the issue of the Washington daily, culled from the
      houseboat, there was, amidst the usual melange of social, diplomatic,
      political and city news, no marked passage to show any reason for its
      having been in the possession of &ldquo;Smith.&rdquo; Average Jones had studied and
      restudied the columns, both reading matter and advertising, until he knew
      them almost by heart. During the period of waiting for his order to be
      brought he was brooding over the problem, when he felt a hand-pressure on
      his shoulder and turned to confront Mr. Thomas Colvin McIntyre, solemn of
      countenance and groomed with a supernal modesty of elegance, as befitted a
      rising young diplomat, already Fifth Assistant Secretary of State of the
      United States of America.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Tommy,&rdquo; said the breakfaster. &ldquo;What'll you have to drink? An
      entente cordialer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't joke,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I'm in a pale pink funk. I'm afraid to look
      into the morning papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! What have you been up to that's scandalous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't me,&rdquo; replied the diplomat ungrammatically. &ldquo;It's Telfik Bey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Telfik Bey? Wait a minute. Let me think.&rdquo; The name had struck a response
      from some thought wire within Average Jones' perturbed brain. Presently it
      came to him as visualized print in small head-lines, reproduced to the
      mind's eye from the Washington newspaper which he had so exhaustively
      studied.

      No arrest, it appeared, had been made. The &ldquo;story,&rdquo; indeed, was brief, and
      of no intrinsic importance other than as a social note. But to Average
      Jones it began to glow luminously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Telfik Bey?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn't. Up to yesterday he was a guest of this hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! Skipped without paying his bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;ah. Skipped&mdash;that is, left suddenly without paying his
      bill, if you choose to put it that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone was significant. Average Jones' good natured face became grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon, Tommy. Was he a friend of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He was, in a sense, a ward of the Department, over here on
      invitation. This is what has almost driven me crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fumbling nervously in the pocket of his creaseless white waistcoat he
      brought forth a death notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the Dial,&rdquo; he said, handing it to Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clipping looked conventional enough.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     DIED&mdash;July 21, suddenly at the Hotel
     Palatia: Telfik Bey of Stamboul, Turkey.
     Funeral services from the Turkish
     Embassy, Washington, on Tues.  Ana Alhari.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the newspapers ever discover&mdash;&rdquo; The young diplomat stopped short
      before the enormity of the hypothesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks straight enough to me as a death notice, except for the tail.
      What does 'Ana Alhari' mean? Sort of a requiescat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; like a mice!&rdquo; said young Mr. McIntyre bitterly. &ldquo;It means 'Hurrah!'
      That's the sort of requiescat it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Then they got him the second time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by 'second time?&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Washington incident, of course, was the first; the attempted murder&mdash;that
      is, the narrow escape of Telfik Bey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Mr. McIntyre looked baffled. &ldquo;I'm blessed if I know what you're up
      to, Jones,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But if you do know anything of this case I need your
      help. In Washington, where they failed, we fooled the newspapers. Here,
      where they've succeeded&mdash;&ldquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are 'they?'&rdquo; interrupted Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I'm here to get at. The murderers of Telfik Bey, of course.
      My instructions are to find out secretly, if at all. For if it does get
      into the newspapers there'll be the very deuce to pay. It isn't desirable
      that even Telfik Bey's presence here should have been known for reasons
      which&mdash;ah&mdash;(here Average Jones remarked the resumption of his
      friend's official bearing)&mdash;which, not being for the public, I need
      not detail to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not, in point of fact, tell me anything about it at all,&rdquo;
       observed Average Jones equably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pomposity fell away from Mr. Thomas Colvin McIntyre, leaving him palpably
      shivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I need your help. Need it very much. You know something about
      handling the newspapers, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know how to get things in; not how to keep them out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other groaned. &ldquo;It may already be too late. What newspapers have you
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of 'em. Want me to look?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. McIntyre braced himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turk dies at Palatia,&rdquo; read Average Jones. &ldquo;Mm&mdash;heart disease...
      wealthy Stamboul merchant... studying American methods... Turkish minister
      notified.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Practically.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the other reports?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones ran them swiftly over. &ldquo;About the same. Hold on! Here's a
      little something extra in the Universal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Found on the floor... bell-boy who discovered the tragedy collapses...
      condition serious... Supposedly shock&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; interrupted young Mr. McIntyre, half rising. &ldquo;Shot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're nervous, Tommy. I didn't say 'shot.' Said 'shock.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course. Shock&mdash;the bell-boy, it means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here; first thing you know you'll be getting me interested. Hadn't
      you better open up or shut up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. McIntyre took a long breath and a resolution simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate I can trust you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Telfik Bey is not a merchant. He
      is a secret, confidential agent of the Turkish government. He came over to
      New York from Washington in spite of warnings that he would be killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're certain he was killed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wish I could believe anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The coroner and a physician whom I sent can find no trace of a wound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apoplexy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The refuge of the mystified medico. It doesn't satisfy you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't satisfy the State Department.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And possibly not the newspapers, eventually.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up with me and look the place over, Average. Let me send for the
      manager.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That functionary came, a vision of perturbation in a pale-gray coat. Upon
      assurance that Average Jones was &ldquo;safe&rdquo; he led the way to the rooms so
      hastily vacated by the spirit of the Turkish guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've succeeded in keeping two recent suicides and a blackmail scheme in
      this hotel out of the newspapers,&rdquo; observed the manager morosely. &ldquo;But
      this would be the worst of all. If I could have known, when the Turkish
      Embassy reserved the apartment&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Turkish Embassy never reserved any apartment for Telfik Bey,&rdquo; put in
      the Fifth Assistant Secretary of State.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you are mistaken, sir,&rdquo; replied the hotel man. &ldquo;I saw their
      emissary myself. He specified for rooms on the south side, either the
      third or fourth floor. Wouldn't have anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gave him a definite reservation?&rdquo; asked Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; 335 and 336.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has the man been here since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to my knowledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Turk, you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so. Foreign, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything about him strike you particularly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he was tall and thin and looked sickly. He talked very soft, too,
      like a sick man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The characterization of the Pearlington station agent recurred to the
      interrogator's mind. &ldquo;Had he&mdash;er&mdash;white hair?&rdquo; he half yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No,&rdquo; replied the manager, and, in the same breath, the budding diplomat
      demanded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you up to, Average? Why should he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones turned to him. &ldquo;To what other hotels would the Turkish
      Embassy be likely to send its men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes their charge d'affaires goes to the Nederstrom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go up there and find out whether a room has been reserved for Telfik Bey,
      and if so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wouldn't reserve at two hotels, would they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By whom,&rdquo; concluded Average Jones, shaking his head at the interruption.
      &ldquo;Find out who occupied or reserved the apartments on either side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thomas Colvin McIntyre lifted a wrinkling eyebrow. &ldquo;Really, Jones,&rdquo; he
      observed, &ldquo;you seem to be employing me rather in the capacity of a
      messenger boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you think a messenger boy could do it as well, ring for one,&rdquo; drawled
      Average Jones, in his mildest voice. &ldquo;Meantime, I'll be in the Turk's room
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Numbers 335 and 336, which the manager opened, after the prompt if
      somewhat sulky departure of Mr. McIntyre, proved to consist of a small
      sitting room, a bedroom and a bath, each with a large window giving on the
      cross-street, well back from Fifth Avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's where he was found.&rdquo; The manager indicated a spot near the wall of
      the sitting-room and opposite the window. &ldquo;He had just pushed the button
      when he fell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bronson, the bell-boy on that call, answered. He knocked several times
      and got no answer. Then he opened the door and saw Mr. Telfik down, all in
      a heap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Bronson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the hospital, unconscious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shock, the doctors say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;er&mdash;about the&mdash;er&mdash;shot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The manager looked startled. &ldquo;Well, Bronson says that just as he opened
      the door he saw a bullet cross the room and strike the wall above the
      body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't see a bullet in flight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He saw this one,&rdquo; insisted the manager. &ldquo;As soon as it struck it
      exploded. Three other people heard it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did Bronson do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lost his head and ran out. He hadn't got halfway to the elevator when he
      fell, in a sort of fainting fit. He came to long enough to tell his story.
      Then he got terribly nauseated and went off again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's sure the man had fallen before the explosion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he got no answer to his knocking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. That's why he went in. He thought something might be wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had anybody else been in the room or past it within a few minutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely no one. The floor girl's desk is just outside. She must have
      seen anyone going in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she anything to add?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She heard the shot. And a minute or two before, she had heard and felt a
      jar from the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corroborative of the man having fallen before the shot,&rdquo; commented Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I got here, five minutes later, he was quite dead,&rdquo; continued the
      manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidence of the explosion was slight to the investigating eye of Average
      Jones. The wall showed an abrasion, but, as the investigator expected, no
      bullet hole. Against the leg of a desk he found a small metal shell, which
      he laid on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's your bullet,&rdquo; he observed with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a cartridge, anyway,&rdquo; cried the hotel man. &ldquo;He must have been shot,
      after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From inside the room? Hardly! And certainly not with that. It's a very
      small fulminate of mercury shell, and never held lead. No. The man was
      down, if not dead, before that went off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones was now at the window. Taking a piece of paper from his
      pocket he brushed the contents of the window-sill upon it. A dozen dead
      flies rolled upon the paper. He examined them thoughtfully, cast them
      aside and turned back to the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who occupy the adjoining rooms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two maiden ladies did, on the east. They've left,&rdquo; said the manager
      bitterly. &ldquo;Been coming here for ten years, and now they've quit. If the
      facts ever get in the newspapers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's on the west, adjoining?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. The corridor runs down there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it isn't probable that any one got into the room from either side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; said the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Thomas Colvin McIntyre arrived with a flushed face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Average,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The same man had reserved rooms at the
      Nederstrom for Telfik Bey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the location?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tenth floor; north side. He had insisted on both details. Nos. 1015,
      1017.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What neighbors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bond salesman on one side, Reverend and Mrs. Salisbury, of Wilmington, on
      the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-m-m. What across the street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I know? You didn't tell me to ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the Glenargan office building, just opened, Mr. Jones,&rdquo; volunteered
      the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones turned again to the window, closed it and fastened his
      handkerchief in the catch. &ldquo;Leave that there,&rdquo; he directed the manager.
      &ldquo;Don't let any one into this room. I'm off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stopping to telephone, Average Jones ascertained that there were no vacant
      offices on the tenth floor, south side of the Glenargan apartment
      building, facing the Nederstrom Hotel. The last one had been let two weeks
      before to&mdash;this he ascertained by judicious questioning&mdash;a dark,
      foreign gentleman who was an expert on rugs. Well satisfied, the
      investigator crossed over to the skyscraper across from the Palatia. There
      he demanded of the superintendent a single office on the third floor,
      facing north. He was taken to a clean and vacant room. One glance out of
      the window showed him his handkerchief, not opposite, but well to the
      west.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too near Fifth Avenue,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don't like the roar of the traffic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's one other room on this floor, farther along,&rdquo; said the
      superintendent, &ldquo;but it isn't in order. Mr. Perkins' time isn't up till
      day after tomorrow, and his things are there yet. He told the janitor,
      though, that he was leaving town and wouldn't bother to take away the
      things. They aren't worth much. Here's the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They entered the office. In it were only a desk, two chairs and a scrap
      basket. The basket was crammed with newspapers. One of them was the Hotel
      Register. Average Jones found Telfik Bey's name, as he had expected, in
      its roster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll give fifty dollars for the furniture as it stands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to get it,&rdquo; was the prompt response. &ldquo;Will you want anything else,
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Send the janitor here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That worthy, upon receipt of a considerable benefaction, expressed himself
      ready to serve the new tenant to the best of his ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know when Mr. Perkins left the building?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. This morning, early.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning! Sure it wasn't yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I sure? Didn't I help him to the street-car and hand him his little
      package? That sick he was he couldn't hardly walk alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones pondered a moment. &ldquo;Do you think he could have passed the
      night here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he did,&rdquo; was the prompt response. &ldquo;The scrubwoman heard him when
      she came this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes' sir. Sobbing, like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nerves of Average Jones gave a sharp &ldquo;kickback,&rdquo; like a mis-cranked
      motor-car. His trend of thought had suddenly been reversed. The devious
      and scientific slayer of Telfik Bey in tears? It seemed completely out of
      the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may go,&rdquo; said he, and seating himself at the desk, proceeded to an
      examination of his newly acquired property. The newspapers in the scrap
      basket, mainly copies of the Evening Register, seemed to contain, upon
      cursory examination, nothing germane to the issue. But, scattered among
      them, the searcher found a number of fibrous chips. They were short and
      thick; such chips as might be made by cutting a bamboo pole into cross
      lengths, convenient for carrying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The 'spirit-wand,&rdquo;' observed Average Jones with gusto. &ldquo;That was the
      'little package,' of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next, he turned his attention to the desk. It was bare, except for a few
      scraps of paper and some writing implements. But in a crevice there shone
      a glimmer of glass. With a careful finger-nail Average Jones pushed out a
      small phial. It had evidently been sealed with lead. Nothing was in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its discoverer leaned back and contemplated it with stiffened eyelids.
      For, upon its tiny, improvised label was scrawled the &ldquo;Mercy sign;&rdquo;
       mysterious before, now all but incredible.
    </p>
    <p>
      For silent minutes Average Jones sat bemused. Then, turning in a messenger
      call, he drew to him a sheet of paper upon which he slowly and
      consideringly wrote a few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You get a dollar extra if this reaches the advertising desk of the
      Register office within half an hour,&rdquo; he advised the uniformed urchin who
      answered the call. The modern mercury seized the paper and fled forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Punctuality was a virtue which Average Jones had cultivated to the point
      of a fad. Hence it was with some discountenance that his clerk was obliged
      to apologize for his lateness, first, at 4 P. M. Of July 23, to a very
      dapper and spruce young gentleman in pale mauve spats, who wouldn't give
      his name; then at 4:05 P. m. of the same day to Professor Gehren, of the
      Metropolitan University; and finally at 4:30 P. m. to Mr. Robert Bertram.
      When, only a moment before five, the Ad-Visor entered, the manner of his
      apology was more absent than fervent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram held out a newspaper to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cast your eye on that,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The Register fairly reeks with freaks
      lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones read aloud.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     SMITH-PERKINS, formerly 74 Bellair-Send
     map present location H. C. Turkish Triumph
     about smoked out.  MERCY&mdash;Box 34, Office.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't know about its being so freakish,&rdquo; said Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Look at it! Turkish Triumph&mdash;that's a cigarette, isn't it?
      H. C.&mdash;what's that? And signed Mercy. Why, it's the work of a
      lunatic!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's my work,&rdquo; observed Average Jones blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three visitors stared a him in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather a forlorn hope, but sometimes a bluff will go,&rdquo; he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If H. C. indicates Harvey Craig, as I infer,&rdquo; said Professor Gehren
      impatiently, &ldquo;are you so infantile as to suppose that his murderer will
      give information about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones smiled, drew a letter from his pocket, glanced at it and
      called for a number in Hackensack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the 'phone, Professor Gehren,&rdquo; he said, when the reply came. &ldquo;It's
      the Cairnside Hospital. Ask for information about Harvey Craig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With absorbed intentness the other three listened to the one-sided
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!... May I speak to Mr. Harvey Craig's doctor?... This is Professor
      Gehren of the Metropolitan University... Thank you, Doctor. How is he?...
      Very grave?... Ah, has been very grave .... Wholly out of danger?... What
      was the nature of his illness?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When may I see him?... Very well. I will visit the hospital to-morrow
      morning. Thank you.... I should have expected that you would notify me of
      his, presence.&rdquo; intervened, then &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is most inexplicable,&rdquo; declared Professor Gehren, turning to the
      others. &ldquo;The doctor states that Harvey was brought there at night, by a
      foreigner who left a large sum of money to pay for his care, and certain
      suggestions for his treatment. One detail, carefully set down in writing,
      was that if reddish or purple dots appeared under Harvey's nails, he was
      to be told that Mr. Smith released him and advised his sending for his
      friends at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reddish or purple dots, eh?&rdquo; repeated Average Jones. &ldquo;I should like&mdash;er&mdash;to
      have talked with&mdash;er&mdash;that doctor before you cut off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, sir,&rdquo; said the professor, with the grim repression of the thinker
      stirred to wrath, &ldquo;should like to interview this stranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly feasible, I think,&rdquo; returned Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean that you've located him already!&rdquo; cried young Mr.
      McIntyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was so obliging as to save me the trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones held up the letter from which he had taken the Cairnside
      Hospital's telephone number. &ldquo;The advertisement worked to a charm. Mr.
      Smith gives his address in this, and intimates that I may call upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Mr. McIntyre rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're going to see him, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I understand you to imply that I am at liberty to accompany you?&rdquo;
       inquired Professor Gehren.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you care to take the risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think there'll be excitement?&rdquo; asked Bertram languidly. &ldquo;I'd like to go
      along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones nodded. &ldquo;One or a dozen; I fancy it will be all the same to
      Smith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think we'll find him dead.&rdquo; Young Mr. McIntyre leaped to this
      conclusion. &ldquo;Count me in on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no; not dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps his friend 'Mercy' has gone back on him, then,&rdquo; suggested Mr.
      McIntyre, unabashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I rather think that's it,&rdquo; said Average Jones, in a curious accent.
      &ldquo;'Mercy' has gone back on him, I believe, though I can't quite accurately
      place her as yet. Here's the taxi,&rdquo; he broke off. &ldquo;All aboard that's going
      aboard. But it's likely to be dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Across town and far up the East Side whizzed the car, over the bridge that
      leads away from Manhattan Island to the north, and through quiet streets
      as little known to the average New Yorker as are Hong Kong and Caracas. In
      front of a frame house it stopped. On a side porch, over which bright
      roses swarmed like children clambering into a hospitable lap, sat a man
      with a gray face. He was tall and slender, and his hair, a dingy black,
      was already showing worn streaks where the color had faded. At Average
      Jones he gazed with unconcealed surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah; it is you!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;are the 'Mercy' of the
      advertisement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And these gentlemen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are my friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones examined a nodding rose with an indulgent, almost a
      paternal, expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&mdash;er&mdash;think it&mdash;er&mdash;safe,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As if exacting a pledge the young man held out his hand. The older one
      unhesitatingly grasped it. Average Jones turned the long fingers, which
      enclosed his, back upward, and glanced at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, and nodded soberly, &ldquo;so, it is that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it is that,&rdquo; assented the other. &ldquo;I perceive that you have
      communicated with Mr. Craig. How is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well. A fine and manly youth. I should have sorely regretted it
      if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Professor Gehren broke in upon him. &ldquo;For the peril in which you have
      involved him, sir, you have to answer to me, his guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The foreigner raised a hand. &ldquo;He was without family or ties. I told him
      the danger. He accepted it. Once he was careless&mdash;and one is not
      careless twice in that work. But he was fortunate, too. I, also, was
      fortunate in that the task was then so far advanced that I could complete
      it alone. I got him to the hospital at night; no matter how. For his
      danger and illness I have indemnified him in the sum of ten thousand
      dollars. Is it enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Professor Gehren bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Mr. Jones; are you a detective?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; merely a follower of strange trails&mdash;by taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah. You have set yourself to a dark one. You wish to know how Telfik Bey&rdquo;&mdash;his
      eyes narrowed and glinted&mdash;&ldquo;came to his reward. Will you enter,
      gentlemen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know this much,&rdquo; replied Average Jones as, followed by his friends, he
      passed through the door which their host held open. &ldquo;With young Craig as
      an assistant, you prepared, in the loneliest part of the Hackensack
      Meadows, some kind of poison which, I believe, can be made with safety
      only in the open air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The foreigner smiled and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not with safety, even then,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You found that your man was coming to New York. Knowing that he would
      probably put up at the Palatia or the Nederstrom, you reserved rooms for
      him at both, and took an office across from each. As it was hot weather,
      you calculated upon his windows being open. You watched for him. When he
      came you struck him down in his own room with the poison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how?&rdquo; It was the diplomat who interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think with a long blow-gun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; said Bertram softly. &ldquo;So the spirit-wand of bamboo was a
      blow-gun! What led you to that, Average?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The spirit rappings, which the talky woman in the Bellair Street
      apartment used to hear. That and the remnants of putty I found near the
      window. You see the doors opening through the whole length of the
      apartment gave a long range, where Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Smith could
      practice. He had a sort of target on the window, and every time he blew a
      putty ball Mrs. Doubletongue heard the spirit. Am I right, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The host bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fumes, whatever they were, killed swiftly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did. Instantly; mercifully. Too mercifully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you know it was fumes?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Thomas Colvin McIntyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the dead flies, the effect upon the bell-boy, and the fact that no
      wound was found on the body. Then, too, there was the fulminate of mercury
      shell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what possible use was that?&rdquo; asked Professor Gehren.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A question that I've asked myself, sir, a great many times over in the
      last twenty-four hours. Perhaps Mr. Smith could answer that best. Though&mdash;er&mdash;I
      think the shell was blown through the blowpipe to clear the deadly fumes
      from the room by its explosion, before any one else should suffer. Smith
      is, at least, not a wanton slaughterer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, sir, and I thank you,&rdquo; said the foreigner. He drew himself
      up weakly but with pride. &ldquo;Gentlemen, I am not a murderer. I am an
      avenger. It would have gone hard with my conscience had any innocent
      person met death through me. As for that Turkish dog, you shall judge for
      yourself whether he did not die too easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From among the papers in a tiroir against the wall he took a French
      journal, and read, translating fluently. The article was a bald account of
      the torture, outrage and massacre of Armenian women and girls, at Adana,
      by the Turks. The most hideous portion of it was briefly descriptive of
      the atrocities perpetrated by order of a high Turkish official upon a
      mother and two young daughters. &ldquo;An Armenian prisoner, being dragged by in
      chains, went mad at the sight,&rdquo; the correspondent stated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was that prisoner,&rdquo; said the reader. &ldquo;The official was Telfik Bey. I
      saw my naked daughter break from the soldiers and run to him, pleading for
      pity, as he sat his horse; and I saw him strike his spur into her bare
      breast. My wife, the mother of my children&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't!&rdquo; The protest came from the Fifth Assistant Secretary of State.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had risen. His smooth-skinned face was contracted, and the sweat stood
      beaded on his forehead. &ldquo;I&mdash;I can't stand it. I've got my duty to do.
      This man has made a confession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pardon,&rdquo; said the foreigner. &ldquo;I have lived and fed on and slept with
      that memory, ever since. On my release I left my country. The enterprise
      of which I had been the head, dye-stuff manufacturing, had interested me
      in chemistry. I went to England to study further. Thence I came to America
      to wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard his confession, all of you,&rdquo; said young Mr. McIntyre,
      rising. &ldquo;I shall have him put under arrest pending advice from
      Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, may save yourself the trouble, I think, Tommy,&rdquo; drawled Average
      Jones. &ldquo;Mr. Smith will never be called to account in this world for the
      murder&mdash;execution of Telfik Bey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw the marks on my finger-nails,&rdquo; said the foreigner. &ldquo;That is the
      sure sign. I may live twenty-four hours; I may live twice or three times
      that period. The poison does its work, once it gets into the blood, and
      there is no help. It matters nothing. My ambition is satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is because of this that you let us find you?&rdquo; asked Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a curiosity to know who had so strangely traced my actions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what was the poison?&rdquo; asked Professor Gehren.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Mr. Jones has more than a suspicion,&rdquo; replied the doomed man,
      with a smile. &ldquo;You will find useful references on yonder shelf, Mr.
      Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moving across to the shelf, Average Jones took down a heavy volume and ran
      quickly over the leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said presently, and not noticing, in his absorption, that the
      host had crossed again to the tiroir and was quietly searching in a
      compartment, he read aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little is known of cyanide of cacodyl, in its action the swiftest and
      most deadly of existing poisons. In the '40's, Bunsen, the German chemist,
      combined oxide of cacodyl with cyanogen, a radical of prussic acid,
      producing cyanide of cacodyl, or diniethyl arsine cyanide. As both of its
      components are of the deadliest description, it is extremely dangerous to
      make. It can be made only in the open air, and not without the most
      extreme precaution known to science. Mr. Lacelles Scott, of England,
      nearly lost his life experimenting with it in 1904. A small fraction of a
      grain gives off vapor sufficient to kill a human being instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you known about this stuff, Average?&rdquo; asked Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'd never beard of it. But from its action and from the lettered
      cabinet, I judged that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is all very well,&rdquo; broke in Mr. Assistant Secretary Thomas Colvin
      McIntyre, &ldquo;but I want this man arrested. How can we know that he isn't
      shamming and may not escape us, after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this,&rdquo; retorted their host. He held aloft a small glass vial,
      lead-seated, and staggered weakly to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop him!&rdquo; said Average Jones sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door closed on the words. There was a heavy fall without, followed by
      the light tinkle of glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones, who had half crossed the room in a leap, turned to his
      friends, warning them back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late. We can't go out yet. Wait for the fumes to dissipate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stood, the four men, rigid. Presently Average Jones, opening a rear
      window, leaped to the ground, followed by the others, and came around the
      corner of the porch. The dead man lay with peaceful face. Professor Gehren
      uncovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forgive him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Who shall say that he was not right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said the young assistant secretary in awed tones. &ldquo;I'm glad he
      escaped. But what am I to do? Here we are with a dead body on our hands,
      and a state secret to be kept from the prying police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones stood thinking for a moment, then he entered the room and
      called up the coroner's office on the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, you men,&rdquo; he said to his companions. Then, to the official who
      answered: &ldquo;There's a suicide at 428 Oliver Avenue, the Bronx. Four of us
      witnessed it. We had come to keep an appointment with the man in
      connection with a discovery he claimed in metallurgy, and found him dying.
      Yes; we will wait here. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Returning to the porch again, he cleared away the fragments of glass,
      aided by Bertram. To one of these clung a shred of paper. For all his
      languid self-control the club dilettante shivered a little as he thrust at
      it with a stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, Average, it's the 'Mercy' sign again. What a hideous travesty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones shook his bead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't 'Mercy,' Bert. It's the label that he attached, for precaution,
      to everything that had to do with his deadly stuff. The formula for
      cyanide of cacodyl is 'Me-2CY.' It was the scrawly handwriting that
      misled; that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I was right when I suggested that his 'Mercy' had gone back on him,&rdquo;
       said Mr. Thomas Colvin McIntyre, with a semi-hysterical giggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones looked from the peaceful face of the dead to the label,
      fluttering in the light breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said gravely. &ldquo;You were wrong. It was his friend to the last.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. BLUE FIRES
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cabs for comfort; cars for company,&rdquo; was an apothegm which Average Jones
      had evolved from experience. A professed student of life, he maintained,
      must keep in touch with life at every feasible angle. No experience should
      come amiss to a detective; he should be a pundit of all knowledge. A
      detective he now frankly considered himself; and the real drudgery of his
      unique profession of Ad-Visor was supportable only because of the
      compensating thrill of the occasional chase, the radiance of the Adventure
      of Life glinting from time to time across his path.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were few places, Average Jones held, where human nature in the rough
      can be studied to better advantage than in the stifling tunnels of the
      subway or the close-packed sardine boxes of the metropolitan surface
      lines. It was in pursuance of this theory that he encountered the
      Westerner, on Third avenue car. By custom, Average Jones picked out the
      most interesting or unusual human being in any assembly where he found
      himself, for study and analysis. This man was peculiar in that he alone
      was not perspiring in the sodden August humidity. The clear-browned skin
      and the rangy strength of the figure gave him a certain distinction. He
      held in his sinewy hands a doubly folded newspaper. Presently it slipped
      from his hold to the seat beside him. He stared at the window opposite
      with harassed and unseeing eyes. Abruptly he rose and went out on the
      platform. Average Jones picked up the paper. In the middle of the column
      to which it was folded was a marked advertisement:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     ARE you in an embarrassing position?  Anything,
     anywhere, any time, regardless of nature or location.
     Everybody's friend.  Consultation at all hours.
     Suite 152, Owl Building, Brooklyn.
</pre>
    <p>
      The car was nearing Brooklyn Bridge. Average Jones saw his man drop
      lightly off. He followed and at the bridge entrance caught him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've left your paper,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger whirled quickly. &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thanks. Perhaps you can
      tell me where the Owl Building is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slight wrinkle of surprise appeared on the man's tanned forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you wouldn't,&rdquo; he returned coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words, 'mind your business,&rdquo;' said Average Jones, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something of that sort,&rdquo; admitted the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, I wouldn't consult with Everbody's Friend over in the Owl
      Building.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;because&mdash;er&mdash;if I may speak plainly,&rdquo; drawled Average
      Jones, &ldquo;I wouldn't risk a woman's name with a gang of blackmailers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got your nerve,&rdquo; retorted the stranger. The keen eyes, flattening
      almost to slits, fixed on the impassive face of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll go you,&rdquo; he decided, after a moment. His glance swept the
      range of vision and settled upon a rathskeller sign. &ldquo;Come over there
      where we can talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They crossed the grilling roadway, and, being wise in the heat, ordered
      &ldquo;soft&rdquo; drinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;you've declared in on my game. Make good.
      What's your interest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, personally. I like your looks, that's all,&rdquo; replied the other
      frankly. &ldquo;And I don't like to see you run into that spider's web.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twice in the last year I've made 'em change their place of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't know me. And you spoke of a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been studying you on the car,&rdquo; explained Average Jones. &ldquo;You're hard
      as nails; yet your nerves are on edge. It isn't illness, so it must be
      trouble. On your watch-chain you've got a solitaire diamond ring. Not for
      ornament; you aren't that sort of a dresser. It's there for, convenience
      until you can find a place to put it. When a deeply troubled man wears an
      engagement ring on his watch chain it's a fair inference that there's been
      an obstruction in the course of true love. Unless I'm mistaken, you, being
      a stranger newly come to town, were going to take your case to those
      man-eating sharks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know I've just come to town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you looked at your watch I noticed it was three hours slow. That
      must mean the Pacific coast, or near it. Therefore you've just got in from
      the Far West and haven't thought to rectify your time. At a venture I'd
      say you were a mining man from down around the Ray-Kelvin copper district
      in Arizona. That peculiar, translucent copper silicate in your scarf-pin
      comes from those mines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Blue Fire? I wish it had stayed there, all of it! Anything else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Average Jones, warming to the game. &ldquo;You're an Eastern
      college man, I think. Anyway, your father or some older member of your
      family graduated from one of the older colleges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gold of your Phi Beta Kappa key is a different color from your
      watch-chain. It's the old metal, antedating the California gold. Did your
      father graduate some time in the latter forties or early fifties?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hamilton, '51. I'm '89. Name, Kirby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A gleam of pleasure appeared in Average Jones keen eyes. &ldquo;That's rather a
      coincidence,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Two of us from the Old Hill. I'm Jones of '04. Had
      a cousin in your class, Carl Van Reypen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They plunged into the intimate community of interest which is the peculiar
      heritage and asset of the small, close-knit old college. Presently,
      however, Kirby's forehead wrinkled again. He sat silent, communing with
      himself. At length he lifted his head like one who has taken a resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You made a good guess at a woman in the case,&rdquo; he, said. &ldquo;And you call
      this a coincidence? She'd say it was a case of intuition. She's very
      strong on intuition and superstition generally.&rdquo; There was a mixture of
      tenderness and bitterness in his tone. &ldquo;Chance brought that advertisement
      to her eyes. A hat-pin she'd dropped stuck through it, or something of the
      sort. Enough for her. Nothing would do but that I should chase over to see
      the Owl Building bunch. At that, maybe her hunch was right. It's brought
      me up against you. Perhaps you can help me. What are you? A sort of
      detective?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only on the side.&rdquo; Average Jones drew a card from his pocket, and
      tendered it:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             A. JONES, AD-VISOR

     Advice upon all matters connected with

</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ad-Visor, eh?&rdquo; repeated the other. &ldquo;Well, there's going to be an
      advertisement in the Evening Truth to-day, by me. Here's a proof of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones took the slip and read it.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     LOST&mdash;Necklace of curious blue stones from
     Hotel Denton, night of August 6.  Reward
     greater than value of stones for return to
     hotel.  No questions asked.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reward greater than value of stones,&rdquo; commented Average Jones. &ldquo;There's a
      sentimental interest, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take the case?&rdquo; returned Kirby abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least I'll look into it,&rdquo; replied Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to the hotel, then, and lunch with me, and I'll open up the whole
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Across a luncheon-table, at the quiet, old-fashioned Hotel Denton, Kirby
      unburdened himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know all that's necessary about me. The&mdash;the other party in the
      matter is Mrs. Hale. She's a young widow. We've been engaged for six
      months; were to be married in a fortnight. Now she insists on a
      postponement. That's where I want your help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones moved uneasily in his chair. &ldquo;Really, Mr. Kirby, lovers'
      quarrels aren't in my line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's been no quarrel. We're as much engaged now as ever, in spite of
      the return of the ring. It's only her infern&mdash;her deep-rooted
      superstition that's caused this trouble. One can't blame her; her father
      and mother were both killed in an accident after some sort of 'ghostly
      warning.' The first thing I gave her, after our engagement, was a necklace
      of these stones&rdquo;&mdash;he tapped his scarf pin&mdash;&ldquo;that I'd selected,
      one by one, myself. They're beautiful, as you see, but they're not
      particularly valuable; only semiprecious. The devil of it is that they're
      the subject of an Indian legend. The Indians and Mexicans call them &ldquo;blue
      fires,&rdquo; and say they have the power to bind and loose in love. Edna has
      been out in that country; she's naturally high strung and responsive to
      that sort of thing, as I told you, and she fairly soaked in all that
      nonsense. To make it worse, when I sent them to her I wrote that&mdash;that&mdash;&rdquo;
       a dull red surged up under the tan skin&mdash;&ldquo;that as long as the fire in
      the stones burned blue for her my heart would be all hers. Now the
      necklace is gone. You can imagine the effect on a woman of that
      temperament. And you can see the result.&rdquo; He pointed with a face of misery
      to the solitaire on his watch-chain. &ldquo;She insisted on giving this back.
      Says that a woman as careless as she proved herself can't be trusted with
      jewelry. And she's hysterically sure that misfortune will follow us for
      ever if we're married without recovering the fool necklace. So she's
      begged a postponement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Details,&rdquo; said Average Jones crisply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's here at this hotel. Has a small suite on the third floor. Came down
      from her home in central New York to meet my mother, whom she had never
      seen. Mother's here, too, on the same floor. Night before last Mrs. Hale
      thought she heard a noise in her outer room. She made a look-see, but
      found nothing. In the morning when she got up, about ten (she's a late
      riser) the necklace was gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where had it been left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On a stand in her sitting-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything else taken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the strange part of it. Her purse, with over a hundred dollars in
      it, which lay under the necklace, wasn't touched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she usually leave valuables around in that casual way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, she's always stayed at the Denton and she felt perfectly
      secure here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any other thefts in the hotel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I can discover. But one of the guests on the same floor with
      Mrs. Hale saw a fellow acting queerly that same night. There he sits,
      yonder, at that table. I'll ask him to come over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guest, an elderly man, already interested in the case, was willing
      enough to tell all he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was awakened by some one fumbling at my door and making a clinking
      noise,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I called out. Nobody answered. Almost immediately I
      heard a noise across the hall. I opened my door. A man was fussing at the
      keyhole of the room opposite. He was very clumsy. I said, 'is that your
      room?' He didn't even look at me. In a moment he started down the hallway.
      He walked very fast, and I could hear him muttering to himself. He seemed
      to be carrying something in front of him with both hands. It was his keys,
      I suppose. Anyway I could hear it clink. At the end of the hall he
      stopped, turned to the door at the left and fumbled at the keyhole for
      quite a while. I could bear his keys clink again. This time, I suppose, he
      had the right room, for be unlocked it and went in. I listened for fifteen
      or twenty minutes. There was nothing further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones looked at Kirby with lifted brows of inquiry. Kirby nodded,
      indicating that the end room was Mrs. Hales'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was the man dressed?&rdquo; asked Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grayish dressing-gown and bed-slippers. He was tall and had gray hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many thanks. Now, Mr. Kirby, will you take me to see Mrs. Hale?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young widow received them in her sitting-room. She was of the slender,
      big-eyed, sensitive type of womanhood; her piquant face marred by the
      evidences of sleeplessness and tears. To Average Jones she gave her
      confidence at once. People usually did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt sure the advertisement would bring us help,&rdquo; she said wistfully.
      &ldquo;Now, I feel surer than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith helps the worst case,&rdquo; said the young man, smiling. &ldquo;Mr. Kirby
      tells me that the intruder awakened you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and I'm a very heavy sleeper. Still I can't say positively that
      anything definite roused me; it was rather an impression of some one's
      being about. I came out of my bedroom and looked around the outer room,
      but there was nobody there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't think to look for the necklace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said with a little gasp; &ldquo;if I only had!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;er&mdash;you didn't happen to hear a clinking noise, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After he'd got into the room he'd put the key up, wouldn't he?&rdquo; suggested
      Kirby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're assuming that he had a key.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he had a key. The guest across the ball saw him trying it on
      the other doors and heard it clink against the lock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he had a key to this room why did he try it on several other doors
      first?&rdquo; propounded Average Jones. &ldquo;As for the clinking noise, in which I'm
      a good deal interested&mdash;may I look at your key, Mrs. Hale?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She handed it to him. He tried it on the lock, outside, jabbing at the
      metal setting. The resultant sound was dull and wooden. &ldquo;Not much of the
      clink which our friend describes as having heard, is it?&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how could he get into my room?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Hale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure your door was locked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certain. As soon as I missed the necklace I looked at the catch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was in the morning. But the night before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always slip the spring. And I know I did this time because it had been
      left unsprung so that Mr. Kirby's mother could come in and out of my
      sitting-room, and I remember springing it when she left for bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes these locks don't work.&rdquo; Slipping the catch back, Average Jones
      pressed the lever down. There was a click, but the ward failed to slip. At
      the second attempt the lock worked. But repeated trials proved that more
      than half the time the door did not lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; observed Average Jones, &ldquo;I think we may dismiss the key theory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the locked door this morning?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Hale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The intruder may have done that as he left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see why,&rdquo; protested Kirby, in a tone which indicated a waning
      faith in Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By way of confusing the trail. Possibly he hoped to suggest that he'd
      escaped by the fire-escape. Presumably he was on the balcony when Mrs.
      Hale came out into this room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke Average Jones laid a hand on the heavy net curtains which hung
      before the balcony window. Instead of parting them, however, he stood with
      upturned eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that curtain torn before yesterday?&rdquo; he asked Mrs. Hale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly think so. The hotel people are very, careful in the up-keep of
      the rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jones mounted a chair with scant respect for the upholstery, and examined
      the damaged drapery. Descending, he tugged tentatively at the other
      curtain, first with his right hand, then with his left; then with both.
      The fabric gave a little at the last test. Jones disappeared through the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned, after five minutes, he held in his hand some scrapings
      of the rusted iron which formed the balcony railing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a mining man, Mr. Kirby,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Would you say that assayed
      anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kirby examined the glinting particles. &ldquo;Gold,&rdquo; he said decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, then the necklace rubbed with some violence against the railing. Now,
      Mrs. Hale, how long were you awake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten or fifteen minutes. I remember that a continuous rattling of wagons
      below kept up for a little while. And I heard one of the drivers call out
      something about taking the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;really!&rdquo; Average Jones became suddenly absorbed in his seal
      ring. He turned it around five accurate times and turned it back an equal
      number of revolutions. &ldquo;Did he&mdash;er&mdash;get any answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man pondered, then drew a chair up to, Mrs. Hale's escritoire,
      and, with an abrupt &ldquo;excuse me,&rdquo; helped himself to pen, ink and paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he said, after five minutes' work. &ldquo;That'll do for a starter. You
      see,&rdquo; he added, handing the product of his toil to Mrs. Hale, &ldquo;this street
      happens to be the regular cross-town route for the milk that comes over by
      one of the minor ferries. If you heard a number of wagons passing in the
      early morning they were the milk-vans. Hence this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hale read:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;MILK-DRIVERS, ATTENTION&mdash;Delaware Central
     mid-town route. Who talked to man outside
     hotel early morning of August 7?  Twenty
     dollars to right man.  Apply personally to
     Jones, Ad-Visor, Astor Court Temple, New York.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the coming issue of the Milk-Dealers' Journal,&rdquo; explained its author.
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Kirby, I want you to find out for me&mdash;Mrs. Hale can help
      you, since she has known the hotel people for years&mdash;the names of all
      those who gave up rooms on this floor, or the floors above or below,
      yesterday morning, and ask whether they are known to the hotel people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think the thief is still in the hotel?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Hale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly. But I think I see smoke from your blue fires. To make out the
      figure through the smoke is not&mdash;&rdquo; Average Jones broke off, shaking
      his head. He was still shaking his head when he left the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took three days for the milk-journal advertisement to work. On the
      afternoon of August tenth, a lank, husky-voiced teamster called at the
      office of the Ad-Visor and was passed in ahead of the waiting line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm after that twenty,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Earn it,&rdquo; said Average Jones with equal brevity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hotel Denton. Guy on the third floor balcony&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right so far.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Leanin' on the rail as if he was sick. I give him a hello. 'Takin' a nip
      of night air, Bill?' I says. He didn't say nothin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he do anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kinder fanned himself an' jerked his head back over his shoulder. Meanin'
      it was too hot to sleep inside, I reckon. It sure was hot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanned himself? How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like this.&rdquo; The visitor raised his hands awkwardly, cupped them, and drew
      them toward his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;with both hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see him go in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's your twenty,&rdquo; said Average Jones. &ldquo;You're long on sense and short
      on words. I wish there were more like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. Thanks again,&rdquo; said the teamster, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Kirby had sent his list of the guests who had given up their
      rooms on August seventh:
    </p>
    <p>
      George M. Weaver, Jr., Utica, N. Y., well known to hotel people and
      vouched for by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walker Parker, New Orleans, ditto.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Charles Hull; quiet elderly people; first visit to hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry M. Gillespie, Locke, N. Y. Middle-aged man; new guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      C. F. Willard, Chicago; been going to hotel for ten years; vouched for by
      hotel people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armed with the list, Average Jones went to the Hotel Denton and spent a
      busy morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had a little talk with the hotel servants,&rdquo; said he to Kirby, when
      the latter called to make inquiries. &ldquo;Mr. Henry M. Gillespie, of Locke,
      New York, had room 168. It's on the same floor with Mrs. Hale's suite, at
      the farther end of the hall. He had only one piece of luggage, a suitcase
      marked H. M. G. That information I got from the porter. He left his room
      in perfect order except for one thing: one of the knobs on the headboard
      of the old fashioned bed was broken off short. He didn't mention the
      matter to the hotel people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you make of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a stout knob. Only a considerable effort of strength exerted in a
      peculiar way would have broken it as it was broken. There was something
      unusual going on in room 168, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think Henry M. Gillespie, of Locke, New York, is our man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Westerner's square jaw fell. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because there's no such person as Henry M. Gillespie, of Locke, New York.
      I've just sent there and found out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three stones of the fire-blue necklace returned on the current of
      advertised appeal. One was brought in by the night bartender of a
      &ldquo;sporting&rdquo; club. He had bought it from a man who had picked it up in a
      gutter; just where, the finder couldn't remember. For the second a South
      Brooklyn pawnbroker demanded (and received) an exorbitant reward. A
      florist in Greenwich, Connecticut, contributed the last. With that patient
      attention to detail which is the A. B. C. of detective work, Average Jones
      traced down these apparently incongruous wanderings of the stones and then
      followed them all, back to Mrs. Hale's fire-escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bartender's stone offered no difficulties. The setting which the
      pawnbroker brought in had been found on the city refuse heap by a
      scavenger. It had fallen through a grating into the hotel cellar, and had
      been swept out with the rubbish to go to the municipal &ldquo;dump.&rdquo; The
      apparent mystery of the florist was lucid when Jones found that the hotel
      exchanged its shop-worn plants with the Greenwich Floral Company. His
      roaming eye, keen for every detail, had noticed a row of tubbed azaleas
      within the ground enclosure of the Denton. Recalling this to mind, it was
      easy for the Ad-Visor to surmise that the gem had dropped from the
      fire-escape into a tub, which was, shortly after, shipped to the florist.
      Thus it was apparent that the three jewels had been stripped from the
      necklace by forcible contact with the iron rail of the fire-escape at the
      point where Average Jones had found the &ldquo;color&rdquo; of precious metal. The
      stones were identified by Kirby, from a peculiarity in the setting, as the
      end three, nearest the clasp at the back; a point which Jones carefully
      noted. But there the trail ended. No more fire-blue stones came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three weeks Average Jones issued advertisements like commands. The
      advertisements would, perhaps, have struck the formal-minded Kirby as
      evidences of a wavering intellect. Indeed, they present a curious and
      incongruous appearance upon the page of Average Jones' scrapbook, where
      they now mark a successful conclusion. The first reads as follows:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     OH, YOU HOTEL MEN! Come through with the
     dope on H. M. G.  What's he done to your place?
     Put a stamp on it and we'll swap dates on his past
     performances.
     A. Jones, Astor Court Temple, New York City.
</pre>
    <p>
      This was spread abroad through the medium of Mine Host's Weekly and other
      organs of the hotel trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was followed by this, of a somewhat later date:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     WANTED-Slippery Sams, Human Eels, Fetter
     Kings etc Liberal reward to artist who sold
     Second-hand amateur, with instructions for
     use.  Send full details, time and place to
     A. Jones, Court Temple, New York City.
</pre>
    <p>
      Variety, the Clipper and the Billboard scattered the appeal broadcast
      throughout &ldquo;the profession.&rdquo; Thousands read it, and one answered it. And
      within a few days after receiving that answer Jones wired to Kirby:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably found. Bring Mrs. Hale to-morrow at 11. Answer. A. JONES.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kirby answered. He also telegraphed voluminously to his ex-fiancee, who
      had returned to her home, and who replied that she would leave by the
      night train. Some minutes before the hour the pair were at Average Jones'
      office. Kirby fairly pranced with impatience while they were kept waiting
      in a side room. The only other occupant was a man with a large black
      dress-suit case, who sat at the window in a slump of dejection. He raised
      his head for a moment when they were summoned and let it sag down again as
      they left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones greeted his guests cordially. Their first questions to him
      were significant of the masculine and feminine differences in point of
      view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got the necklace?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Hale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got the thief?&rdquo; queried Kirby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't got the necklace and I haven't got the thief,&rdquo; announced
      Average Jones; &ldquo;but I think I've got the man who's got the necklace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the thief hand it over to him?&rdquo; demanded Kirby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you conversant with the Baconian system of thought, which Old Chips
      used to preach to us at Hamilton?&rdquo; countered Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgotten it if I ever knew it,&rdquo; returned Kirby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I infer from your repeated use of the word 'thief.' Bacon's principle&mdash;an
      admirable principle in detective work&mdash;is that we should learn from
      things and not from the names of things. You are deluding yourself with a
      name. Because the law, which is always rigid and sometimes stupid, says
      that a man who takes that which does not belong to him is a thief, you've
      got your mind fixed on the name 'thief,' and the idea of theft. If I had
      gone off on that tack I shouldn't have the interesting privilege of
      introducing to you Mr. Harvey M. Greene, who now sits in the outer room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H. M. G.,&rdquo; said Kirby quickly. &ldquo;Is it possible that that decent-looking
      old boy out there is the man who stole&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; interrupted Average Jones with emphasis, &ldquo;and I shall ask
      you, whatever may occur, to guard your speech from offensive expressions
      of that sort while he is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, if you say so,&rdquo; acquiesced the other. &ldquo;But do you mind telling
      me how you figure out a man traveling under an alias and helping himself
      to other people's property on any other basis than that he's a thief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A, B, C,&rdquo; replied Average Jones; &ldquo;as thus: A&mdash;Thieves don't wander
      about in dressing-gowns. B&mdash;Nor take necklaces and leave purses. C&mdash;Nor
      strip gems violently apart and scatter them like largess from
      fire-escapes. The rest of the alphabet I postpone. Now for Mr. Greene.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man from the outer room entered and nervously acknowledged his
      introduction to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Greene,&rdquo; explained Jones, &ldquo;has kindly consented to help clear up the
      events of the night of August sixth at the Hotel Denton and&rdquo;&mdash;he
      paused for a moment and shifted his gaze to the newcomer's narrow shoes&mdash;&ldquo;and&mdash;er&mdash;the
      loss of&mdash;er&mdash;Mrs. Hale's jeweled necklace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boots retracted sharply, as under the impulse of some sudden emotion;
      startled surprise, for example. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Greene, in obvious
      amazement. &ldquo;I don't know anything about a necklace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A twinkle of satisfaction appeared at the corners of Average Jones' eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That also is possible,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;If you'll permit the form of an
      examination; when you came to the Hotel Denton on August sixth, did you
      carry the same suitcase you now have with you, and similarly packed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es. As nearly as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. You were registered under the name of Henry M. Gillespie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other's voice was low and strained as he replied in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For good reasons of your own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For which same reasons you left the hotel quite early on the following
      morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your business compels you to travel a great deal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you often register under an alias?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned the other, his face twitching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not always?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a large city and a strange hotel, for example, you'd take any name
      which would correspond to the initials, H. M. G., on your dress-suit case.
      But in a small town where you were known, you'd be obliged to register
      under your real name of Harvey M. Greene. It was that necessity which
      enabled me to find you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to know how you did it,&rdquo; said the other gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the left-hand drawer of his desk Jones produced a piece of netting,
      with hooks along one end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you recognize the material, Mrs. Hale,&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it's the same stuff as the Hotel Denton curtains, isn't it?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Average Jones, attaching it to the curtain rod at the side
      door. &ldquo;Now, will you jerk that violently with one hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will tear loose, won't it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just what it will do. Try it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fabric ripped from the hooks as she jerked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember,&rdquo; said Jones, &ldquo;that your curtain was torn partly across, and
      not ripped from the hook at all. Now see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught the netting in both hands and tautened it sharply. It began to
      part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awkward,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;yet it's the only way it could have been done. Now,
      here's a bedpost, exactly like the one in room 168, occupied by Mr. Greene
      at the Denton. Kirby, you're a powerful man. Can you break that knob off
      with one hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wedged the post firmly in a chair for the trial. The bedpost resisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you do it with both hands?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably, if I could get a hold. But there isn't surface enough for a
      good hold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there isn't. But now.&rdquo; Jones coiled a rope around the post and handed
      the end to Kirby. He pulled sharply. The knob snapped and rolled on the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Q. E. D.,&rdquo; said Kirby. &ldquo;But it doesn't mean anything to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn't it? Let me recall some other evidence. The guest who saw Mr.
      Greene in the hallway thought he was carrying something in both hands. The
      milk driver who hailed him on the balcony noticed that he gestured
      awkwardly with both hands. In what circumstances would a man use both
      hands for action normally performed with one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much drink,&rdquo; hazarded Kirby, looking dubiously at Greene, who had
      been following Jones' discourse with absorbed attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly. But it wouldn't fit this case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Physical weakness,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Hale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather a shrewd suggestion. But no weakling broke off that bedpost in
      Henry M. Gillespie's room. I assumed the theory that the phenomena of that
      night were symptomatic rather than accidental. Therefore, I set out to
      find in what other places the mysterious H. M. G. had performed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know my initials really were H. M. G.?&rdquo; asked Mr. Greene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The porter at the Denton had seen them 'Henry M. Gillespie's' suitcase.
      So I sent out loudly printed call to all hotel clerks for information
      about a troublesome H. M. G.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed the &ldquo;OH, YOU HOTEL MEN&rdquo; advertisement to the little group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty of replies came. You have, if I may say it without offense, Mr.
      Greene, an unfortunate reputation among hotel proprietors. Small wonder
      that you use an alias. From the Hotel Carpathia in Boston I got a response
      more valuable than I had dared to hope. An H. M. G. guest&mdash;H. Morton
      Garson, of Pillston, Pennsylvania (Mr. Greene nodded)&mdash;had wrecked
      his room and left behind him this souvenir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaning over, Jones pulled, clinking from the scrap-basket, a fine steel
      chain. It was endless and some twelve feet in total length, and had two
      small loops, about a foot apart. Mrs. Hale and Kirby stared at it in
      speechless surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is mine,&rdquo; said Mr. Greene with composure. &ldquo;I left it because it
      had ceased to be serviceable to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! That's very interesting,&rdquo; said Average Jones with a keen glance. &ldquo;Of
      course when I examined it and found no locks, I guessed that it was a
      trick chain, and that there were invisible springs in the wrist loops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should any one chain Mr. Greene to his bed with a trick chain?&rdquo;
       questioned Mrs. Hale, whose mind had been working swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He chained himself,&rdquo; explained Jones, &ldquo;for excellent reasons. As there is
      no regular trade in these things, I figured that he probably bought it
      from some juggler whose performance had given him the idea. So,&rdquo; continued
      Jones, producing a specimen of his advertisements in the theatrical
      publications, &ldquo;I set out to find what professional had sold a 'prop', to
      an amateur. I found the sale had been made at Marsfield, Ohio, late in
      November of last year, by a 'Slippery Sam,' termed 'The Elusive Edwardes.'
      On November twenty-eighth of last year Mr. Harvey M. Greene, of Richmond,
      Virginia, was registered at the principal, in fact the only decent hotel,
      at Barsfield. I wrote to him and here he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but where is my necklace?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Hale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my word of honor, madam, I know nothing of your necklace,&rdquo; asserted
      Greene, with a painful contraction of his features. &ldquo;If this gentleman can
      throw any more light&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can,&rdquo; said Average Jones. &ldquo;Do you remember anything of that
      night's events after you broke off the bedpost and left your room&mdash;the
      meeting with a guest who questioned you in the hall, for example?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. Not a thing until I awoke and found myself on the fire-escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awoke?&rdquo; cried Kirby. &ldquo;Were you asleep all the time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I'm a confirmed sleep-walker worst type. That's why I go under
      an alias. That's why I got the trick handcuff chain and chained myself up
      with it, until I found it drove me fighting', crazy in my sleep when I
      couldn't break away. That's why I slept in my dressing-gown that night at
      the Denton. There was a red light in the hall outside and any light,
      particularly a colored one, is likely to set me going. I probably dreamed
      I was escaping from a locomotive&mdash;that's a common delusion of mine&mdash;and
      sought refuge in the first door that was open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; said Average Jones. &ldquo;You&mdash;er&mdash;say that you are&mdash;er&mdash;peculiarly
      susceptible to&mdash;er&mdash;colored light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Hale, was the table on which the necklace lay in line with any light
      outside?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think probably with the direct ray of an electric globe shining through
      the farther window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Mr. Greene,&rdquo; said, Average Jones, &ldquo;the glint of the fire-blue
      stones undoubtedly caught your eye. You seized on the necklace and carried
      it out on the fire-escape balcony, where the cool air or the milk-driver's
      hail awakened you. Have you no recollection of seeing such a thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the faintest, unhappily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he must have dropped it to the ground below,&rdquo; said Kirby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so,&rdquo; controverted Jones slowly. &ldquo;Mr. Greene must have been
      clinging to it tenaciously when it swung and caught against the railing,
      stripping off the three end stones. If the whole necklace had dropped it
      would have broken up fine, and more than three stones would have returned
      to us in reply to the advertisements. And in that case, too, the chances
      against the end stones alone returning, out of all the thirty-six, are too
      unlikely to be considered. No, the fire-blue necklace never fell to the
      ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly didn't remain on the balcony,&rdquo; said Kirby. &ldquo;It would have
      been discovered there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; assented Average Jones. &ldquo;We're getting at it by the process of
      exclusion. The necklace didn't fall. It didn't stay. Therefore?&rdquo;&mdash;he
      looked inquiringly at Mrs. Hale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It returned,&rdquo; she said quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Mr. Greene,&rdquo; added Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; cried that gentleman vehemently, &ldquo;I haven't set eyes on the
      wretched thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; returned Average Jones; &ldquo;which doesn't at all affect the point I
      wish to make. You may recall, Mr. Greene, that in my message I asked you
      to pack your suitcase exactly as it was when you left the hotel with it on
      the morning of August seventh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've done so with the exception of the conjurer's chain, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Including the dressing-gown you had on, that night, I assume. Have you
      worn it since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It hung in my closet until yesterday, when I folded it to pack. You
      see, I&mdash;I've had to give up the road on account of my unhappy
      failing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then permit me.&rdquo; Average Jones stooped to, the dress-suit case, drew out
      the garment and thrust his hand into its one pocket. He turned to Mrs.
      Hale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you&mdash;er&mdash;mind&mdash;er&mdash;leaning over a bit?&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent her dainty head, then gave a startled cry of delight as the young
      man, with a swift motion, looped over her shoulders a chain of living blue
      fires which gleamed and glinted in the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were there all the time,&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;and you knew it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guessed it,&rdquo; he corrected, &ldquo;by figuring out that they couldn't well be
      elsewhere&mdash;unless on the untenable hypothesis that our friend, Mr.
      Greene here, was a thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which only goes to prove,&rdquo; said Kirby soberly, &ldquo;that evidence may be a
      mighty deceptive accuser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which only goes to prove,&rdquo; amended Average Jones, &ldquo;that there's no fire,
      even the bluest, without traceable smoke.&rdquo;'

      CHAPTER VII. PIN-PRICKS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing is a fake,&rdquo; declared Bertram. He slumped heavily into a chair,
      and scowled at Average Jones' well-littered desk, whereon he had just
      tossed a sheet of paper. His usually impeccable hair was tousled. His
      trousers evinced a distinct tendency to bag at the knees, and his coat was
      undeniably wrinkled. That the elegant and flawless dilettante of the
      Cosmic Club should have come forth, at eleven o'clock of a morning, in
      such a state of comparative disreputability, argued an upheaval of mind
      little short of phenomenal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fake,&rdquo; he reiterated. &ldquo;I've spent a night of pseudo-intellectual riot
      and ruin over it. You've almost destroyed a young and innocent mind with
      your infernal palimpsest, Average.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have it,&rdquo; returned Average Jones with a smile. &ldquo;And I seem to
      recall a lofty intimation on your part that there never was a cipher so
      tough but what you could rope, throw, bind, and tie a pink ribbon on its
      tail in record time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cipher, yes,&rdquo; returned the other bitterly. &ldquo;That thing isn't a cipher.
      It's an alphabetical riot. Maybe,&rdquo; he added hopefully, &ldquo;there was some
      mistake in my copy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look for yourself,&rdquo; said Average Jones, handing him the original.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a singular document, this problem in letters which had come to
      light up the gloom of a November day for Average Jones; a stiffish sheet
      of paper, ornamented on one side with color prints of alluring &ldquo;spinners,&rdquo;
       and on the other inscribed with an appeal, in print. Its original vehicle
      was an envelope, bearing a one-cent stamp, and addressed in typewriting:
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. William H. Robinson, The Caronia, Broadway and Evenside Ave., New York
      City.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advertisement on the reverse of the sheet ran as follows:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     ANGLERS&mdash;When you are looking for
     &ldquo;Baits That Catch Fish,&rdquo; do you see
     these spinners in the store where you
     buy tackle?  You will find here twelve
     baits, every one of which has a record
     and has literally caught tons of fish.
     We call them &ldquo;The 12 Surety Baits.&rdquo;
      We want you to try them for casting and
     trolling these next two months, because
     all varieties of bass are particularly
     savage in striking these baits late in
     the season.

     DEALERS&mdash;You want your customers to have
     these 12 Shoemaker &ldquo;Surety Baits&rdquo; that
     catch fish.  This case will sell itself
     empty over and over again, for every bait
     is a record-breaker and they catch fish.
     We want you to put in one of these cases so
     that the anglers will not be disappointed and
     have to wait for baits to be ordered.  It
     will be furnished FREE, charges prepaid, with
     your order for the dozen bait it contains.
</pre>
    <p>
      The peculiar feature of the communication was that it was profusely
      be-pimpled with tiny projections, evidently made by thrusting a pin in
      from the side which bore the illustrations. The perforations were
      liberally scattered. Most, though not all of them, transfixed certain
      letters. Accepting this as indicative, Bertram had copied out all the
      letters thus distinguished, with the following cryptic result:
    </p>
    <p>
      b-n-o-k-n-o-a-h-i (doubtful) i (doubtful) d-o-o-u-t-s-e-h-w
      h-e-w-a-l-e-w-f-i-h-i-e-l-y-a-n-u-t-t-m-a-m (doubtful) g-e-x-c-s
      (doubtful) s-e M-e-p-c (two punctures) t-y-w-u-s-o-m-e-r-s h-a-s 1
      S-k-t-s-a-s-e-l-e-v-a-h (twice) W-y-o-u (doubtful) h-c-s-e-v-t-l-t-f-r
      (perforated twice) c-a-o-u-c-e-o-c (doubtful) m-t (perforated twice)
      n-o-h-a-e-f-o-u-w-o-r-i-t-h-i-r-e-d-w-l-l-b (Perforated three times)
      f-u-h-g-e-p-d-h-o-d- (doubtful) e-f-h-g-b-t-n-t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the copy's all right,&rdquo; growled Bertram. &ldquo;Tell me again how you came
      by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Robinson came here twice and missed me. Yesterday I got the note from
him which you've seen, with the enclosure which has so threatened your
reason. You know the rest. Perhaps you'd have done well to study the
note for clues to the other document.&rdquo;

 Something in his friend's tone made Bertram glance up suspiciously.
&ldquo;Let me see the note,&rdquo; he demanded.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Average Jones handed it to him. There was no stamp on it; it had been
left by the writer. It was addressed, in rather scrawly chirography, to
&ldquo;A. Jones, Ad-Visor,&rdquo; and read:

                      THE CARONIA, Nov. 18.
MR. A. JONES, Astor Court Temple: I have tried unsuccessfully to see
you twice. Enclosed you will find the reason. Please read through it
carefully. Then I am sure you will see and help me. Money is no object.
I will call to-morrow at noon.
</pre>
    <p>
      Respectfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      WILLIAM H. ROBINSON.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I see nothing out of the ordinary in that,&rdquo; observed Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo; inquired Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram read the message again. &ldquo;Of course the man is rattled. That's
      obvious in his handwriting. Also, he has inverted one sentence in his
      haste and said 'read through it,' instead, of 'read it through.'
      Otherwise, it's ordinary enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be vanity that keeps you from eyeglasses, Bert,&rdquo; Average Jones
      observed with a sigh. &ldquo;Well, I'm afraid I set you on the wrong track,
      myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram lifted an eyebrow with an effort. &ldquo;Meaning, I suppose, that you're
      on the tight and have solved the cipher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cipher be jiggered. You were right in your opening remark. There isn't
      any cipher. If you read Mr. Robinson's note correctly, and if you'd had
      the advantage of working on the original of the advertisement as I have,
      you'd undoubtedly have noticed at once&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; murmured Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;that fully one-third of the pin-pricks don't touch any letters at
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we should have taken the letters which lie between the holes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The letters don't count. It's the punctures. Force your eyes to
      consider those alone, and you will see that the holes themselves form
      letters and words. Read through it carefully, as Robins directed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held the paper up to the light. Bertram made out in straggling
      characters, formed in skeleton the perforations, this legend:
    </p>
    <p>
      ALL POINTS TO YOU TAKE THE SHORT CUT DEATH IS EASIER THAN SOME THINGS.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew! That's a cheery little greeting,&rdquo; remarked Bertram. &ldquo;But why didn't
      friend Robinson point it out definitely in his letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wanted to test my capacity perhaps. Or, it may have been simply that he
      was too frightened and rattled to know just what he was writing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know anything of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only what the directory tells, and directories don't deal in really
      intimate details of biography, you know. There's quite an assortment of
      William H. Robinsons, but the one who lives at the Caronia appears to be a
      commission merchant on Pearl Street. As the Caronia is one of the most
      elegant and quite the most enormous of those small cities within
      themselves which we call apartment houses, I take it that Mr. Robinson is
      well-to-do, and probably married. You can ask him, yourself, if you like.
      He's due any moment, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Promptly, as befitted a business man, Mr. William H. Robinson arrived on
      the stroke of twelve. He was a well-made, well-dressed citizen of
      forty-five, who would have been wholly ordinary save for one peculiarity.
      In a room more than temperately cool he was sweating profusely, and that,
      despite the fact that his light overcoat was on his arm. Not polite
      perspiration, be it noted, such as would have been excusable in a
      gentleman of his pale and sleek plumpness, but soul-wrung sweat, the
      globules whereof gathered in the grayish hollows under his eyes and
      assailed, not without effect, the glistening expanse of his tall white
      collar. He darted a glance at Bertram, then turned to Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had hoped for a private interview,&rdquo; he said in a high piping voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bertram is my friend and business confidant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. You&mdash;you have read it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;then&mdash;then&mdash;&rdquo; The visitor fumble with nerveless
      fingers, at his tightly buttoned cut-away coat. It resisted his efforts.
      Suddenly, with a snarl of exasperation, he dragged violently at the lapel,
      tearing the button outright from the cloth. &ldquo;Look what I have done,&rdquo; he
      said, staring stupidly for a moment at the button which had shot across
      the room. Then, to the amazed consternation of the others, he burst into
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones pushed a chair behind him, while Bertram brought him a glass
      of water. He gulped out his thanks, and, mastering himself after a
      moment's effort, drew a paper from his inner pocket which he placed on the
      desk. It was a certified check for one hundred dollars, made payable to
      Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's the rest of a thousand ready, if you can help me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll talk of that later,&rdquo; said the prospective beneficiary. &ldquo;Sit tight
      until you're able to answer questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Able now,&rdquo; piped the other in his shrill voice. &ldquo;I'm ashamed of myself,
      gentlemen, but the strain I've been under&mdash; When you've heard my
      story&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment, please,&rdquo; interrupted Average Jones, &ldquo;let me get at this my
      own way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any way you like,&rdquo; returned the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Now what is it that points to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know any more than you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are the 'some things' that are worse than death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robinson shook his head. &ldquo;I haven't the slightest notion in the
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor of the 'short cut' which you are advised to take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it means suicide.&rdquo; He paused for a moment. &ldquo;They can't drive me
      to that&mdash;unless they drive me crazy first.&rdquo; He wiped the sweat from
      under his eyes, breathing hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robinson shook his head. In the next question the interrogator's tone
      altered and became more insistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever called in a doctor, Mr. Robinson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only once in five years. That was when my nerves broke down&mdash;under
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you do call in a doctor, is it your habit to conceal your symptoms
      from him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. I see what you mean. Mr. Jones, I give, you my word of
      honor, as I hope to be saved from this persecution, I don't know any more
      than yourself what it means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;er&mdash;I am&mdash;er&mdash;to believe,&rdquo; replied Jones,
      drawling, as he always did when interest, in his mind, was verging on
      excitement, &ldquo;that a simple blind threat like this&mdash;er&mdash;without
      any backing from your own conscience&mdash;er&mdash;could shake you&mdash;er&mdash;as
      this has done? Why, Mr. Robinson, the thing&mdash;er&mdash;may be&mdash;er&mdash;only
      a raw practical joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the others!&rdquo; cried the visitor. His face changed and fell. &ldquo;I believe
      I am going crazy,&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;I didn't tell you about the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diving into his overcoat pocket he drew out a packet of letters which he
      placed on the desk with a sort of dismal flourish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read those!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently.&rdquo; Average Jones ran rapidly over the eight envelopes. With one
      exception, each bore the imprint of some firm name made familiar by
      extensive advertising. All the envelopes were of softish Manila paper
      varying in grade and hue, under one-cent stamps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is the first of the series?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't among those. Unfortunately it was lost, by a stupid servant's
      mistake, pin and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Where I cut open the envelope&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment. You say you cut it open. All these, being one-cent
      postage, must have come unsealed. Was the first different?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It had a two-cent stamp. It was a circular announcement of the
      Swift-Reading Encyclopedia, in a sealed envelope. There was a pin bent
      over the fold of the letter so you couldn't help but notice it. Its head
      was stuck through the blank part of the circular. Leading from it were
      three very small pins arranged as a pointer to the message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember the message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could I forget it! It was pricked out quite small on the blank fold of
      the paper. It said: 'Make the most of your freedom. Your time is short.
      Call at General Delivery, Main P. O., for your warning.' I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And found&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An ordinary sealed envelope, addressed in pinpricks connected by pencil
      lines. The address was scrawly, but quite plain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what did it contain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A commitment blank to an insane asylum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones absently drew out his handkerchief, elaborately whisked from
      his coat sleeve an imaginary speck of dust, and smiled benignantly where
      the dust was supposed to have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insane asylum,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Was&mdash;er&mdash;the blank&mdash;er&mdash;filled
      in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only partly. My name was pricked in, and there was a specification of
      dementia from drug habit, with suicidal tendencies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a quick signal, unseen by the visitor, Average Jones opened the way
      to Bertram, who, in wide range of experience and study had once
      specialized upon abnormal mental phenomena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; that gentleman put in gently, &ldquo;has there ever been any
      dementia in your family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as far as I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or suicidal mania?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All my people have died respectably in their beds,&rdquo; declared the visitor
      with some vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once more, if I may venture. Have you ever been addicted to any drug?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Average Jones took up the examination, &ldquo;will you tell me of any
      enemy who would have reason to persecute you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't an enemy in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're fortunate,&rdquo; returned the other smiling, &ldquo;but surely, some time in
      your career&mdash;business rivalry&mdash;family alienation&mdash;any one
      of a thousand causes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the harassed man. &ldquo;Not for me. My business runs smoothly.
      My relations are mostly dead. I have no friends and no enemies. My wife
      and I live alone, and all we ask,&rdquo; he added in a sudden outburst of almost
      childish resentment, &ldquo;is to be left alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The inquisitor's gaze returned to the packet of letters. &ldquo;You haven't
      complained to the post-office authorities?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And risk the publicity?&rdquo; returned Robinson with a shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, give me over night with these. Oh, and I may want to 'phone you
      presently. You'll be at home? Thank you. Good day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Average Jones to Bertram, as their caller's plump back
      disappeared, &ldquo;this looks pretty, queer to me. What did you think of our
      friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scared but straight,&rdquo; was Bertram's verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to hear it. That's my idea, too. Let's have a look at the material.
      We've already got the opening threat, and the General Delivery follow-up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which shows, at least, that it isn't a case of somebody in the apartment
      house tampering with the mail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not only that. It's a dodge to find out whether he got the first message.
      People don't always read advertisements, even when sealed, as the first
      message-bearing one was. Therefore, our mysterious persecutor says: 'I'll
      just have Robinson prove it to me, if he did get the first message, by
      calling for the second.' Then, after a lapse of time, he himself goes to
      the General Delivery, asks for a letter for Mr. William H. Robinson, finds
      it's gone, and is satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and he'd be sure then that Robinson would go through all the mailed
      ads with a fine-tooth comb, after that. But why the pin-pricks? Just to
      disguise his hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly. It's a fairly effectual disguise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't he address the envelope that way, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The address wouldn't be legible against the white background of the paper
      inside. On the other hand, if he'd addressed all his envelopes by
      pinpricks filled in with pencil lines, the post-office people might get
      curious and look into one. Sending threats through the mail is a serious
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones ran over the letter again. &ldquo;Good man, Robinson!&rdquo; he
      observed. &ldquo;He's penciled the date of receipt on each one, like a fine
      young methodical business gent. Here we are: 'Rec'd July 14. Card from
      Goshorn &amp; Co., Oriental Goods.' Message pricked in through the
      cardboard: 'You are suspected by your neighbors. Watch them.' Not bad for
      a follow-up, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would look like insanity, if it weren't that&mdash;that through the
      letters 'one increasing purpose runs,'&rdquo; parodied Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's one of July thirty-first; an advertisement of the Croiset Line
      tours to the Orient. Listen here, Bert: 'Whither can guilt flee that
      vengeance, may not follow?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't quite see Robinson in the part of guilt,&rdquo; mused Bertram. &ldquo;What's
      next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More veiled accusation. The medium is a church society announcement of a
      lecture on Japanese Feudalism. Date, August seventeenth. Inscription: 'If
      there is no blood on your soul, why do you not face your judges?&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little anti-climactic, don't you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about this one of September seventh, then? Direct reference back to
      the drug habit implied in the commitment blank. It's a testimonial booklet
      of one of the poisonous headache dopes, Lemona Powders. The message is
      pricked through the cover. 'Better these than the hell of suspense.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trying the power of suggestion, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so. The second attempt at it is even more open. An advertisement of
      Shackleton's Safeguard Revolvers. Date, September twenty-second. Advice,
      by pin: 'As well this as any other way.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drug or suicide,&rdquo; remarked Bertram. &ldquo;The man at the other end doesn't
      seem particular which.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's the insane asylum always to fall back on. Under date of October
      first, comes the Latherton Soap Company's impassioned appeal to
      self-shaving manhood. Great Caesar! No wonder poor Robinson was upset.
      Listen to this: 'God himself hates you.' After that there's a three-weeks
      respite, for there's October twenty-second on this one, Kirkby and Dunn's
      offering of five percent water bonds. 'The commission has its spies
      watching you constantly.' Calculated to inspire confidence in the most
      timid soul! Now we come to the soup course: Smith and Perkins' Potted
      Chowder. Date of November third. Er&mdash;Bert&mdash;here's something&mdash;er&mdash;really
      worth while, now. Hark to the song of the pin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He read sonorously:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;Animula, vagula, Bandula,
      Hospes, comesque corporis;
      Quaenunc abibis in loca?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadrian, isn't it?&rdquo; cried Bertram, in utter amazement. &ldquo;Of course it is!
      Hadrian's terrified invocation to his own parting spirit. 'Guest and
      companion of my body; into what places will you now go?' Average, it's
      uncanny! Into what place of darkness and dread is the Demon of the Pin
      trying to drive poor Robinson's spirit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones shook his head. &ldquo;'Pailidula, nudula, rigida,&rdquo;' he completed
      the quatrain. &ldquo;'Ghostpale, stark, and rigid.' He's got a grisly
      imagination, that pin-operator. I shouldn't care to have him on my trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Robinson!&rdquo; protested Bertram feebly. &ldquo;What has a plump, commonplace,
      twentieth-century, cutaway-wearing, flat-inhabiting Robinson to do with a
      Roman emperor's soul-questionings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps the last entry of the lot will tell us. Palmerto's Magazine's
      feature announcement, received November ninth. No; it doesn't give any
      clue to the Latinity. It isn't bad, though. 'The darkness falls.' That's
      all there is to it. And enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say the darkness did fall,&rdquo; confirmed Bertram. &ldquo;It falls&mdash;and
      remains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones pushed the collection of advertisements aside and returned
      to the opening phase of the problem, the fish-bait circular which Robinson
      had mailed him. So long after, that Bertram hardly recognized it as a
      response to his last remark, the investigator drawled out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not such&mdash;er&mdash;impenetrable darkness. In fact,&mdash;er&mdash;Eureka,
      or words to that effect. Bert, when does the bass season end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;November first, hereabouts, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The postmark on the envelope that carried this advertisement to our
      friend advises the use of the baits for 'these next two months.' Queer
      time to be using bass-lures, after the season is closed. Bert, it's a pity
      I can't waggle my ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waggle your ears! For heaven's sake, why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because then I'd be such a perfect jackass that I could win medals at a
      show. I ought to have guessed it at first glance, from the fact that the
      advertisement couldn't well have been mailed to Robinson originally,
      anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he's not in the sporting-goods business, and the advertisement is
      obviously addressed to the retail trade. Don't you remember: it offers a
      showcase, free. What does a man living in an apartment want of a show-case
      to keep artificial bait in? What we&mdash;er&mdash;need here is&mdash;er&mdash;steam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment's manipulation of the radiator produced a small jet. In this
      Average Jones held the envelope. The stamp curled tip and dropped off.
      Beneath it were the remains of a small portion of a former postmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; murmured Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remailed!&rdquo; exclaimed Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remailed,&rdquo; corroborated his friend. &ldquo;I expect we'll find the others the
      same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One by one he submitted the envelopes to the steam bath. Each of them, as
      the stamp was peeled off, exhibited more or less fragmentary signs of a
      previous cancellation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Careless work,&rdquo; criticized Average Jones. &ldquo;Every bit of the mark should
      have been removed, instead of trusting to the second stamp to cover what
      little was left, by shifting it a bit toward the center of the envelope.
      Look; you can see on this one where the original stamp was peeled off. On
      this the traces of erasure are plain enough. That's why Manila paper was
      selected: it's easier to erase from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Robinson faking?&rdquo; asked Bertram. &ldquo;Or has some one been rifling his
      waste-basket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would mean an accomplice in the house, which would be dangerous. I
      think it was done at longer range. As for the question of our friend's
      faking in his claim of complete ignorance of all this, I propose to find
      that out right now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drawing the telephone to him, he called the Caronia apartments. Thus it
      was that Mr. William H. Robinson, for two unhappy minutes, profoundly
      feared that at last he had really lost his mind. This is the conversation
      in which he found himself implicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! Mr. Robinson? This is Mr. A. Jones. You hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Jones. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Integer vitae, scelerisque-purus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;beg your pardon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Non egit Mauris jaculis nec arcu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Mr. Robinson: Mr. William H. Rob&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nec venenatis grasida sag&mdash;Hello! Central, don't cut off! Mr.
      Robinson, do you understand me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows, I don't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he doesn't recognize the Integer Vitae,&rdquo; said Average Jones in a swift
      aside to Bertram, &ldquo;he certainly wouldn't know the more obscure Latin of
      the late Mr. Hadrian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One more question, Mr. Robinson. Is there, in all your acquaintance, any
      person who never goes out without an attendant? Take time to think, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;why,&rdquo; stuttered the appalled subject of this
      examination, and fell into silence. From the depths of the silence he
      presently exhumed the following: &ldquo;I did have a paralytic cousin who always
      went out in a wheeled chair. But she's dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there's no one else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I'm quite sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven! Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that about an attendant?&rdquo; inquired Bertram, as his friend
      replaced the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I've just a hunch that the sender of those messages doesn't go out
      unaccompanied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insane? Or semi-insane? It does rather look like delusional paranoia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As nearly as imperfect humanity may, Average Jones appeared to be smiling
      indulgently at the end of his own nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dare say you're right&mdash;er&mdash;in part, Bert. But I've also a hunch
      that our man Robinson is himself the delusion as well as the object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you wouldn't be cryptic, Average,&rdquo; said his friend pathetically.
      &ldquo;There's been enough of that without your gratuitously adding to the sum
      of human bewilderment.&rdquo;,
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones scribbled a few words on a pad, considered, amended, and
      handed the result over to Bertram, who read:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     WANTED&mdash;Professional envelope eraser to
     remove marks from used envelopes.
     Experience essential.  Apply at once&mdash;A.
     Jones, Ad-Visor, Astor Court Temple.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it enlighten your gloom to see that in every New York and Brooklyn
      paper to-morrow?&rdquo; inquired its inventor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a glimmer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll give this ad a week's repetition if necessary, before trying more
      roundabout measures. As soon as I have heard from it I'll drop in at the
      club and we'll write&mdash;that is to say, compose a letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that I don't know yet. When I do, you'll see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three days later Average Jones entered the Cosmic Club, with that
      twinkling up-turn of the mouth corners which, with him, indicated
      satisfactory accomplishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Bert,&rdquo; he remarked, seeking out his languid friend, in the
      laziest corner of the large divan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd be surprised to know how few experienced envelope erasers there are
      in four millions of population. Only seven people answered that
      advertisement, and they were mostly tyros.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you didn't get your man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a woman. The fifth applicant. Got a pin about you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram took a pearl from his scarf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's good. It will make nice, bold, inevitable sort of letters. Come
      over here to this desk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments he worked at a sheet of, paper with the pin, then threw
      it down in disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This sort of thing requires practice,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Here, Bert, you're
      cleverer with your fingers than I. You take it, and I'll dictate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Between them, after several failures, they produced a fair copy of the
      following:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Alden Honeywell will choose between making explanation to the
      post-office authorities or calling at 3:30 P. m. to-morrow on A. Jones,
      Ad-Visor, Astor Court Temple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This Average Jones enclosed in an envelope which he addressed in writing
      to Alden Honeywell, Esq., 550 West Seventy-fourth Street, City, afterward
      pin-pricking the letters in outline. &ldquo;Just for moral effect,&rdquo; he
      explained. &ldquo;In part this ought to give him a taste of the trouble he made
      for poor Robinson. You'll be there to-morrow, Bert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watch me!&rdquo; replied that gentleman with unwonted emphasis. &ldquo;But will Alden
      Honeywell, Esquire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely. Also Mr. William H. Robinson, of the Caronia. Note that 'of the
      Caronia.' It's significant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At three-thirty the following afternoon three men were waiting in Average
      Jones' inner office. Average Jones sat at his desk sedulously polishing
      his left-hand fore-knuckle with the tennis callous of his right palm.
      Bertram lounged gracefully in the big chair. Mr. Robinson fidgeted. There
      was an atmosphere of tension in the room. At three-forty there came a
      tap-tapping across the floor of the outer room, and a knock at the door
      brought them all to their feet. Average Jones threw the door open, took
      the man who stood outside by the arm, and pushing a chair toward him,
      seated him in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new-comer was an elderly man dressed with sober elegance. In his scarf
      was a scarab of great value; on his left hand a superb signet ring. He
      carried a heavy, gold-mounted stick. His face was curiously divided
      against itself. The fine calm forehead and the deep setting of the widely
      separate eyes gave an impression of intellectual power and balance. But
      the lower part of the face was mere wreckage; the chin quivering and
      fallen, from self-indulgence, the fine lines of the nose coarsened by the
      spreading nostrils; the mouth showing both the soft contours of sensuality
      and the hard, fine line of craft and cruelty. The man's eyes were unholy.
      They stared straight before him, and were dead. With his entrance there
      was infused in the atmosphere a sense of something venomous. &ldquo;Mr. Alden
      Honeywell?&rdquo; said Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The voice had refinement and calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to introduce you to Mr. William H. Robinson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The new-comer's head turned slowly to his right shoulder then back. His
      eyes remained rigid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the man's blind!&rdquo; burst out Mr. Robins in his piping voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blind!&rdquo; echoed Bertram. &ldquo;Did you know this Average?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. The pin-pricks showed it. And the letter mailed to Mr.
      Robinson at the General Delivery, which, if you remember, had the address
      penciled in from pin-holes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you have quite done discussing my personal misfortune,&rdquo; said
      Honeywell patiently, &ldquo;perhaps you will be good enough to tell me which is
      William Robinson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; returned the owner of that name. &ldquo;And do you be good enough to
      tell me why you hound me with your hellish threats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not William Robinson's voice!&rdquo; said the blind man. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William H. Robinson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not William Honeywell Robinson!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; William Hunter Robinson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why am I brought here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make a statement for publication in to-morrow morning's newspaper,&rdquo;
       returned Average Jones crisply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Statement? Is this a yellow journal trap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a courtesy to Mr. Robinson, I'll explain. How long have you lived in
      the Caronia, Mr. Robinson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About eight months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, some three or four months before you moved in, another William H.
      Robinson lived there for a short time. His middle name was Honeywell. He
      is a cousin, and an object of great solicitude to this gentleman here. In
      fact, he is, or will be, the chief witness against Mr. Honeywell in his
      effort to break the famous Holden Honeywell will, disposing of some ten
      million dollars. Am I right, Mr. Honeywell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus far,&rdquo; replied the blind man composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five years ago William Honeywell Robinson became addicted to a patent
      headache 'dope.' It ended, as such habits do, in insanity. He was confined
      two years, suffering from psychasthenia, with suicidal melancholia and
      delusion of persecution. Then he was released, cured, but with a
      supersensitive mental balance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the messages were intended to drive him out of his mind again,&rdquo; said
      Bertram in sudden enlightenment. &ldquo;What a devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Either that, or to impel him, by suggestion, to suicide or to revert to
      the headache powders, which would have meant the asylum again. Anything to
      put him out of the way, or to make his testimony incompetent for the will
      contest. So, when the ex-lunatic returned from Europe a year ago, our
      friend Honeywell here, in some way located him at the Caronia. He matured
      his little scheme. Through a letter broker who deals with the rag and
      refuse collectors, he got all the second-hand mail from the Caronia.
      Meantime, William Honeywell Robinson had moved away, and as chance would
      have it, William Hunter Robinson moved in, receiving the pinprick letters
      which, had they reached their goal, would probably have produced the
      desired effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they drove a sane man nearly crazy, what wouldn't they have done to
      one whose mind wasn't quite right!&rdquo; cried the wronged Robinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But since Mr. Honeywell is blind,&rdquo; said Bertram, &ldquo;how could he see to
      erase the cancellations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! That's what I asked myself. Obviously, he couldn't. He'd have to get
      that done for him. Presumably he'd get some stranger to do it. That's why
      I advertised for a professional eraser who was experienced, judging that
      it would fetch the person who had done Honeywell's work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any such thing as a professional envelope eraser?&rdquo; asked
      Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. So a person of experience in this line would be almost unique. I was
      sure to find the right one, if he or she saw my advertisement. As a matter
      of fact, it turned out to be an unimaginative young woman who has told me
      all about her former employment with Mr. Honeywell, apparently with no
      thought that there was anything strange in erasing cancellations from
      hundreds of envelopes&mdash;for Honeywell was cautious enough not to
      confine her to the Robinson mail alone&mdash;and then pasting on stamps to
      remail them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You appear to have followed out my moves with some degree of acumen, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Jones,&rdquo;
       said the blind schemer suavely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet I might not have solved your processes easily if you had not made one
      rather&mdash;if you will pardon me, stupid mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time, the man's bloated lips shook. His evil pride of
      intellectuality was stung.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; he said hastily. &ldquo;I do not make mistakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? Well, have it as you will. The point that you are to sign here a
      statement, which I shall read to you before these witnesses, announcing
      for publication the withdrawal of your contest for the Honeywell
      millions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I decline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The painful necessity will be mine of turning over these instructive
      documents to the United States postal authorities. But not before giving
      them to the newspapers. How would you look in court, in view of this
      attempt to murder a fellow man's reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Honeywell had now gained his composure. &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he assented.
      &ldquo;You seem to have a singular faculty for being right. Be careful it does
      not fail you&mdash;sometime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; returned Average Jones. &ldquo;Now you will listen, please, all of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He read the brief document, placed it before the blind man, and set a pin
      between his finger and thumb. &ldquo;Sign there,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honeywell smiled as he pricked in his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For identification, I suppose,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Am I to assign no cause to the
      newspapers for my sudden action?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A twinkle of malice appeared in Average Jones' eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would suggest waning mental acumen,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blind man winced palpably as he rose to his feet. &ldquo;That is the second
      time you have taunted me on that. Kindly tell me my mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones led him to the door and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mistake,&rdquo; he drawled as he sped his parting guest into the grasp of
      a waiting attendant, &ldquo;was&mdash;er&mdash;in not remembering that&mdash;er&mdash;you
      mustn't fish for bass in November.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VIII. BIG PRINT
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the Cosmic Club Mr. Algernon Spofford was a figure of distinction.
      Amidst the varied, curious, eccentric, brilliant, and even slightly
      unbalanced minds which made the organization unique, his was the only
      wholly stolid and stupid one. Club tradition declared that he had been
      admitted solely for the beneficent purpose of keeping the more egotistic
      members in a permanent and pleasing glow of superiority. He was very rich,
      but otherwise quite harmless. In an access of unappreciated cynicism,
      Average Jones had once suggested to him, as a device for his newly
      acquired coat-of-arms, &ldquo;Rocks et Praeterea Nihil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the &ldquo;praeterea nihil&rdquo; was something less than fair to Mr. Spofford,
      with whom it was not strictly a case of &ldquo;nothing further&rdquo; besides his
      &ldquo;rocks&rdquo;. Ambition, the vice of great souls, burned within Spofford's
      pigeon-breast. He longed to distinguish himself in the line of endeavor of
      his friend Jones and was prone to proffer suggestions, hints, and even
      advice, to the great tribulation of the recipient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence it was with misgiving that the Ad-Visor opened the door of his
      sanctum to Mr. Spofford, on a harsh December noon. But the misgivings were
      supplanted by pleased surprise when the caller laid in his hand a clipping
      from a small country town paper, to this effect:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     RANSOM&mdash;Lost lad from Harwick not drowned
     or harmed.  Retained for ransom. Safe and
     sound to parents for $50,000. Write,
     Mortimer Morley, General Delivery, N. Y.
     Post-Office.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought that'd catch you,&rdquo; chuckled Mr. Spofford, in great
      self-congratulation. &ldquo;'Jones'll see into this,' I says to myself. 'If he
      don't, I'll explain.' Somethin' to that, ay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones looked from the advertisement to the vacuous smile of Mr.
      Algernon Spofford. &ldquo;Oh, you'll explain, will you?&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;Well,
      the thing I'd like to have explained is&mdash;come over here to the window
      a minute, will you, Algy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Spofford came, and gazed down upon a dispiriting area of rain-swept
      street and bedraggled wayfarers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See that ten-story office building across the way?&rdquo; pursued Average
      Jones. &ldquo;What would you do if, coming in here at midnight, you were to see
      twenty-odd rats ooze out of that building and disperse about their
      business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I'd quit,&rdquo; said the startled promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the obvious solution,&rdquo; retorted &ldquo;but my question wasn't intended
      to elicit a brand of music-hall humor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spofford contemplated the building uneasily. &ldquo;I don't know what you're up
      to, Average,&rdquo; he complained. &ldquo;Is it a catch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it's a test case. What would you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd think it was Billy-be-dashed queer,&rdquo; answered Spofford with profound
      conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're getting on,&rdquo; said Jones tartly. &ldquo;And next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay? How do I know? What're you devilin' me this way for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't call a policeman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Spofford, staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't hustle around and 'phone Central?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet if any one told you you hadn't the sense a policeman, you'd resent
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I would!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jimmy McCue, the night special, who patrols past the corner, saw
      that very thing happen a few nights ago at the Sterriter Building. Knowing
      that rats don't go out at midnight for a saunter, two dozen strong, he
      began to suspect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suspect what?&rdquo; growled Spofford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That there must be some abnormal cause for so abnormal a proceeding.
      Think, now, Algy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard of rats leavin' a sinkin' ship. The building might have been
      sinkin',&rdquo; suggested the visitor hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the best you can do? I'll give you one more try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Spofford. &ldquo;A cat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my soul,&rdquo; declared Average Jones, gazing at his club-mate with
      increased interest, &ldquo;you're the most remarkable specimen of inverted
      mentality I've ever encountered. D'you think a cat habitually rounds up
      two dozen rats and then chivies 'em out into the street for sport? McCue
      didn't have any cat theory. He figured that when rats come out of a place
      that way the place is afire. So he turned in an alarm and saved a two
      hundred and fifty thousand dollar building.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; grunted Spofford. &ldquo;Well, what's that got to do with the
      advertisement I brought you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing in the world, directly. I'm merely trying to figure out, in my
      own way, how a mind like yours could see under the surface print into the
      really interesting peculiarity of this clipping. Now I know that your mind
      didn't do anything of the sort. Come on, now, Algy, who sent this to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin of mine up in Harwick. I wish you weren't so Billy-be-dashed
      sharp, Average. I used to visit in Harwick, so they asked me to get you
      interested in Bailey Prentice's case. He's the lost boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've done it. Now tell me all you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spofford produced a letter which gave the outlines of the case. Bailey
      Prentice's disappearance it was set forth, was the lesser of two
      simultaneous phenomena which violently jarred the somnolent New England
      village of Harwick from its wonted calm. The greater was the &ldquo;Harwick
      meteor.&rdquo; At ten-fifteen on the night of December twelfth, the streets
      being full of people coming from the moving picture show, there was a
      startling concussion from the overhanging clouds and the astounded
      populace saw a ball of flame plunging earthward, to the northwest of the
      town, and waxing in intensity as it fell. Darkness succeeded. But, within
      a minute, a lurid radiance rose and spread in the night. The aerial bolt
      had gone crashing through an old barn on the Tuxall place, setting it
      afire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bailey Prentice was among the very few who did not go to the fire. Taken
      in connection with the fact that he was fourteen years old and very
      thoroughly a boy, this, in itself, was phenomenal. In the excitement of
      the occasion, however, his absence was not noted. But when, on the
      following morning, the Reverend Peter Prentice, going up to call his son,
      found the boy's room empty and the bed untouched, the second sensation of
      the day was launched. Bailey Prentice had, quite simply, vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one offered the theory that, playing truant from the house while his
      father was engaged in work below stairs, he had been overwhelmed and
      perhaps wholly consumed by a detached fragment from the fiery visitant.
      This picturesque suggestion found many supporters until, on the afternoon
      of December fourteenth, a coat and waistcoat were found on the seashore a
      mile north of the village. The Reverend Mr. Prentice identified the
      clothes as his son's. Searching parties covered the beach for miles,
      looking for the body. Preparations were made for the funeral services,
      when a new and astonishing factor was injected into the situation. An
      advertisement, received by mail from New York, with stamps affixed to the
      &ldquo;copy&rdquo; to pay for its insertion, appeared in the local paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here's the advertisement,&rdquo; concluded Mr. Algernon Spofford,
      indicating the slip of paper which he had turned over to Average Jones.
      &ldquo;And if you are going up to Harwick and need help there, why I've got time
      to spare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Algy,&rdquo; replied Average Jones gravely. &ldquo;But I think you'd
      better stay here in case anything turns up at this end. Suppose,&rdquo; he added
      with an inspiration, &ldquo;you trace this Mortimer Morley through the general
      delivery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Spofford innocently satisfied with this wild-goose
      errand. &ldquo;Lemme know if anything good turns up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones took train for Harwick, and within a few hours was rubbing
      his hands over an open fire in the parsonage, whose stiff and cheerless
      aspect bespoke the lack of a woman's humanizing touch for the Reverend Mr.
      Prentice was a widower. Overwrought with anxiety and strain, the
      clergyman, as soon as he had taken his coat, began a hurried,
      inconsequential narrative, broke off, tried again, fell into an
      inextricable confusion of words, and, dropping his head in his hands,
      cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't tell you. It is all a hopeless jumble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said the younger man encouragingly. &ldquo;Comfort yourself with the
      idea that your son is alive, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can I be sure, even of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones glanced at a copy of the advertisement which he held. &ldquo;I
      think we can take Mr. Morley's word so far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so; fifty thousand dollars ransom!&rdquo; said the minister, and stopped
      with a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Average Jones heartily. &ldquo;That advertisement counts for
      nothing. Professional kidnappers do not select the sons of impecunious
      ministers for their prey. Nor do they give addresses through which they
      may be found. You can dismiss the advertisement as a blind; the second
      blind, in fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The second?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. The first was the clothing on the shore. It was put there to
      create the impression that your son was drowned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; we all supposed that he must be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By what possible hypothesis a boy should be supposed to take off coat and
      waistcoat and wade off-shore into a winter sea is beyond my poor powers of
      conjecture,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;No. Somebody 'planted' the clothes there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems far-fetched to me,&rdquo; said the Reverend Mr. Prentice doubtfully.
      &ldquo;Who would have any motive for doing such a thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what we have to find out. What time did your son go to his room
      the night of his disappearance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Earlier than usual, as I remember. A little before nine o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any special reason for his going up earlier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wanted to experiment with a new fishing outfit just given him for his
      birthday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Will you take me to his room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They mounted to the boy's quarters, which overlooked the roof of the side
      porch from a window facing north. The charred ruins of a barn about, half
      a mile away were plainly visible through this window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The barn which the meteor destroyed,&rdquo; said the Reverend Mr. Prentice,
      pointing it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      One glance was all that Average Jones bestowed upon a spot which, for a
      few days, had been of national interest. His concern was inside the room.
      A stand against the wall was littered with bits of shining mechanism. An
      unjointed fishing-rod lay on the bed. Near at hand were a small
      screw-driver and a knife with a broken blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were things in this condition when you came to call Bailey in the morning
      and found him gone?&rdquo; asked Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing has been touched,&rdquo; said the clergyman in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones straightened up and stretched himself languidly. His voice
      when he spoke again took on the slow drawl of boredom. One might have
      thought that he had lost all interest in the case but for the thoughtful
      pucker of the broad forehead which belied his halting accents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;er&mdash;when Bailey left here he hadn't any idea of&mdash;er&mdash;running
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't follow you, Mr. Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Psychology,&rdquo; said Average Jones. &ldquo;Elementary psychology. Here's your
      son's new reel. A normal boy doesn't abandon a brand-new fad when he runs
      away. It isn't in boy nature. No, he was taking this reel apart to study
      it when some unexpected occurrence checked him and drew him outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The meteor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made some inquiries in the village on my way, up. None of the hundreds
      of people who turned out for the fire, remembers seeing Bailey about.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The meteor fell at ten-fifteen. Bailey went upstairs before nine. Allow
      half an hour for taking apart the reel. I don't believe he'd have been
      longer at it. So, it's probable that he was out of the house before the
      meteor fell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have heard him go out of the front door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, perhaps, why he went out of the window,&rdquo; observed Average Jones,
      indicating certain marks on the sill. Swinging his feet over, he stepped
      upon the roof of the porch, and peered at the ground below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And down the lightning rod,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he stood meditating. &ldquo;The ground is now frozen hard,&rdquo; he said
      presently. &ldquo;Bailey's footprints where he landed are deeply marked.
      Therefore the soil must have been pretty soft at the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; agreed the clergyman. &ldquo;There had been a three-day downpour, up to
      the evening of Bailey's disappearance. About nine o'clock the wind shift
      to the northeast, and everything froze hard. There has been no thaw
      since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem very clear on these points, Mr. Prentice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I noted them specially, having in mind to write a paper on the meteorite
      for the Congregationalist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Perhaps you could tell me, then, how soon after the meteor's fall,
      the barn yonder was discovered to be afire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost instantly. It was in full blaze within very short time after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How short? Five minutes or so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so much. Certainly not more than two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm! Peculiar! Ra-a-a-ather peculiar.&rdquo; drawled Average Jones.
      &ldquo;Particularly in view of the weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what respect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In respect to a barn, water-soaked by a three-day rain bursting into
      flame like tinder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It had not occurred to me. But the friction and heat of the meteorite
      must have been extremely great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And extremely momentary except as to the lower floor, and the fire should
      have taken some time to spread from that. However, to turn to other
      matters&mdash;&rdquo; He swung himself over the edge of the roof and went
      briskly down the lightning rod. Across the frozen ground he moved, with
      his eyes on the soil, and presently called up to his, host:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, he started across lots in the direction of the barn. Will
      you come down and let me in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Back in the study, Average Jones sat meditating a few moments. Presently
      he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you go to the spot where your son's clothes were found?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Some time after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the seashore, some half a mile to the east of the Tuxall place, and a
      little beyond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a roadway from the Tuxall place to the spot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I believe not. But one could go across the fields and through the
      barn to the old deserted roadway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah. There's an old roadway, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It skirts the shore to join Boston Pike about three miles up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how far from this roadway were your son's clothes found?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a few feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm. Any tracks in the roadway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I recall seeing some buggy tracks and being surprised, because no
      one ever drives that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is conceivable that your son's clothes might have been tossed
      from a passing vehicle, to the spot where they were discovered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conceivable, certainly. But I can see no grounds for such a conjecture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far down the road, in this direction, did tracks run?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not beyond the fence-bar opening from the Tuxall field, if that is what
      you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, exactly. Do you know this Tuxall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly at all. He is a recent comer among us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I shall probably want to make his acquaintance, later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a care, then. He is very jealous of his precious meteor, and guards
      the ruins of the barn, where it lies, with a shot gun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? He promises to be an interesting study. Meantime, I'd like to
      look at your son's clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
From a closet Mr. Prentice brought out a coat and waistcoat of the
&ldquo;pepper-and-salt&rdquo; pattern which is sold by the hundreds of thousands the
whole country over. These the visitor examined carefully. The coat
was caked with mud, particularly thick on one shoulder. He called the
minister's attention to it.

 &ldquo;That would be from lying wet on the shore,&rdquo; said the Reverend Mr.
Prentice.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. This is mud, not sand. And it's ground or pressed in. Has any
      one tampered with these since they were found?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went through the pockets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones frowned. &ldquo;Find anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of importance. A handkerchief, some odds and ends of string&mdash;oh,
      and a paper with some gibberish on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the nature of this gibberish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why it might have been some sort of boyish secret code, though it was
      hardly decipherable enough to judge from. I remember some flamboyant
      adjectives referring to something three feet high. I threw the paper into
      the waste-basket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning that receptacle out on the table, Average Jones discovered in the
      debris a sheet of cheap, ruled paper, covered with penciled words in print
      characters. Most of these had been crossed out in favor of other words or
      sentences, which in turn had been &ldquo;scratched.&rdquo; Evidently the writer had
      been toilfully experimenting toward some elegance or emphasis of
      expression, which persistently eluded him. Amidst the wreck and ruin of
      rhetoric, however, one phrase stood out clear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stupendous scientific sensation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Below this was a huddle and smudge of words, from which adjectives darted
      out like dim flame amidst smoke. &ldquo;Gigantic&rdquo; showed in its entity followed
      by an unintelligible erasure. At the end this line was the legend &ldquo;3 Feet
      High.&rdquo; &ldquo;Verita Visitor,&rdquo; appeared below, and beyond it, what seemed to be
      the word &ldquo;Void.&rdquo; And near the foot of the sheet the student of all this
      chaos could make faintly but unmistakably, &ldquo;Marvelous Man-l&mdash;&rdquo; the
      rest of the word being cut off by a broad black smear. &ldquo;Monster 3 Feet.&rdquo;
       The remainder was wholly undecipherable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones looked up from this curio, and there was a strange
      expression in the eyes which met the minister's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;er&mdash;threw this in the&mdash;er&mdash;waste-basket.&rdquo; he
      drawled. &ldquo;In which pocket was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The waistcoat. An upper one, I believe. There was a pencil there, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you an old pair of shoes of Bailey's,&rdquo; asked the visitor abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I suppose so. In the attic somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please bring them to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Mr. Prentice left the room. No sooner had the door closed
      after him than Average Jones jumped out of his chair stripped to his
      shirt, caught up the pepper-and-salt waistcoat, tried it on and buttoned
      it across his chest without difficulty; then thrust his arm into the coat
      which went with it, and wormed his way, effortfully, partly into that. He
      laid it aside only when he had determined that he could get it no farther
      on. He was clothed and in his right garments when the Reverend Mr.
      Prentice returned with a much-worn pair of shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will these do?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones hardly gave them the courtesy of a glance. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said
      indifferently, and set them aside. &ldquo;Have you a time-table here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're going to leave?&rdquo; cried the clergyman, in sharp disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In just half an hour,&rdquo; replied the visitor, holding his finger on the
      time-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; cried Mr. Prentice, &ldquo;that is the train back to New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you're not going to see Tuxall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor to examine the place where the clothes were found?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Jones, are you giving up the attempt to discover what became of my
      boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what became of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister put out a hand and grasped the back of a chair for support.
      His lips parted. No sound came from them. Average Jones carefully folded
      the paper of &ldquo;gibberish&rdquo; and tucked it away in his card case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bailey has been carried away by two people in a buggy. They were
      strangers to the town. He was injured and unconscious. They still have
      him. Incidentally, he has seriously interfered with a daring and highly
      ingenious enterprise. That is all I can tell you at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman found his voice. &ldquo;In heaven, Mr. Jones,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;tell me
      who and what these people are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know who they are. I do know what they are. But it can do no good
      to tell you the one until I can find out the other. Be sure of one thing,
      Bailey is in no further danger. You'll hear from me as soon as I have
      anything definite to report.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that the Reverend Mr. Prentice had to be content; that and a few days
      later, a sheet of letter-paper bearing the business imprint of the
      Ad-Visor, and enclosing this advertisement:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     WANTED&mdash;3 Ft. type for sensational Bill Work.
     Show samples.  Delivery in two weeks.  A. Jones,
     Ad-Visor, Court Temple, N. Y. City.
</pre>
    <p>
      Had the Reverend Mr. Prentice been a reader of journals devoted to the art
      and practice of printing he might have observed that message widely
      scattered to the trade. It was answered by a number of printing shops.
      But, as the answers came in to Average Jones, he put them aside, because
      none of the seekers for business was able to &ldquo;show samples.&rdquo; Finally there
      came a letter from Hoke and Hollins of Rose Street. They would like Mr.
      Jones to call and inspect some special type upon which they were then at
      work. Mr. Jones called. The junior member received him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite providential, Mr. Jones,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We're turning out some
      single-letter, hand-made type of just the size you want. Only part of the
      alphabet, however. Isn't that a fine piece of lettering!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held up an enormous M to the admiration of his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; approved Average Jones. &ldquo;I'd like to see other letters; A,
      for example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hollins produced a symmetrical A.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, an R, if you please; and perhaps a V.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hollis looked at his visitor with suspicion. &ldquo;You appear to be
      selecting the very letters which I have,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those which&mdash;er&mdash;would make up the&mdash;er&mdash;legend,
      'Marvelous Man-Like Monster,&rdquo; drawled Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you know the Farleys,&rdquo;' said the print man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Flying Farleys?&rdquo; said Average Jones. &ldquo;They used to do ascensions with
      firework trimmings, didn't they? No; I don't exactly know them. But I'd
      like to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's another matter,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Hollins, annoyed at having betrayed
      himself. &ldquo;This type is decidedly a private&mdash;even a secret-order. I
      had no right to say anything about it or the customers who ordered it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, you could see that a letter left here for them reached them, I
      suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After some hesitation, the other agreed. Average Jones sat down to the
      composition of an epistle, which should be sufficiently imperative without
      being too alarming. Having completed this delicate task to his
      satisfaction he handed the result to Hollins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you haven't already struck off a line, you might do so,&rdquo; he suggested.
      &ldquo;I've asked the Farleys for a print of it; and I fancy they'll be sending
      for one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the shop he went direct to a telegraph office, whence he
      dispatched two messages to Harwick. One was to the Reverend Peter
      Prentice, the other was to the local chief of police. On the following
      afternoon Mr. Prentice trembling in the anteroom of the Ad-Visor's. With
      the briefest word of greeting Average Jones led him into his private
      office, where a clear-eyed boy, with his head swathed in bandages sat
      waiting. As the Ad-Visor closed the door after him, he heard the
      breathless, boyish &ldquo;Hello, father,&rdquo; merged in the broken cry of the
      Reverend Peter Prentice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes he gave father and son. When he returned to the room,
      carrying a loose roll of reddish paper, he was followed by a strange
      couple. The woman was plumply muscular. Her attractive face was both
      defiant and uneasy. Behind her strode a wiry man of forty. His chief claim
      to notice lay in an outrageously fancy waistcoat, which was ill-matched
      with his sober, commonplace, &ldquo;pepper-and-salt&rdquo; suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Farley, the Reverend Mr. Prentice,&rdquo; said Average Jones in
      introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The strangers in the wagon?&rdquo; asked the clergyman quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same,&rdquo; admitted the woman briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Mr. Prentice turned upon Farley. &ldquo;Why did you want to steal
      my boy away?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't want to. Had to,&rdquo; replied that gentleman succinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's do this in order,&rdquo; suggested Average Jones. &ldquo;The principal actor's
      story first. Speak up, Bailey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know my own story,&rdquo; said the boy with a grin. &ldquo;Only part of it.
      Mrs. Farley's been awful good to me, takin' care of me an' all that. But
      she wouldn't tell me how I got hurt or where I was when I woke up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. Well, we must piece it out among us. Now, Bailey, you were
      working over your reel the night the meteor fell, when&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What meteor? I don't know anything about a meteor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you don't,&rdquo; said Average Jones laughing. &ldquo;Stupid of me. For the
      moment I had forgotten that you were out of the world then. Well, about
      nine o'clock of the night you got the reel, you looked out of your window
      and saw a queer light over at the Tuxall place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right. But say, Mr. Jones, how do you know about the light?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else but a light could you have seen, on a pitch-black night?&rdquo;
       counter-questioned Average Jones with a smile. &ldquo;And it must have been
      something unusual, or you wouldn't have dropped everything to go to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what!&rdquo; corroborated the boy. &ldquo;A kind of flame shot up from the
      ground. Then it spread a little. Then it went out. And there were people
      running around it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Some one must have got careless with the oil,&rdquo; observed Average
      Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fool Tuxall!&rdquo; broke in Farley with an oath. &ldquo;It was him gummed the
      whole game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Tuxall, I regret to say,&rdquo; remarked Average Jones, &ldquo;has left for parts
      unknown, so the Harwick authorities inform me, probably foreseeing a
      charge of arson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arson?&rdquo; repeated the Reverend Mr. Prentice in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Only oil and matches could have made a barn flare up, after a
      three-days' rain, as his did. Now, Bailey, to continue. You ran across the
      fields to the Tuxall place and went around&mdash;let me see; the wind had
      shifted to the northeast&mdash;yes; to the northeast of the barn and quite
      a distance away. There you saw a man at work in his shirt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well-I'll-be-jiggered!&rdquo; said the boy in measured tones. &ldquo;Where were you
      hiding, Mr. Jones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not behind the tree there, anyway,&rdquo; returned the Ad-Visor with a chuckle.
      &ldquo;There is a tree there, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and there was something alive tied up in it with a rope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not exactly alive,&rdquo; returned Average Jones, &ldquo;though the mistake is
      a natural one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, I know,&rdquo; persisted Bailey. &ldquo;While Mr. and Mrs. Farley were
      workin' over some kind of a box, I shinned up the tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bold young adventurer! And what did you find?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the limbs was shakin' and thrashin'. I crawled out on it. I guess
      it was kind o' crazy me, but I was goin' to find out what was what if I
      broke my neck. There was a rope tied to it, and some big thing up above
      pullin' and jerkin' at it, tryin' to get away. Pretty soon, Mr. and Mrs.
      Farley came almost under me. He says: 'Is Tuxall all ready?' and she says:
      'He thinks we ought to wait half an hour. The street'll be full of folks
      then. Then he says: 'Well, I hate to risk it, but maybe it's better.' just
      then, the rope gave a twist and came swingin' over on me, and knocked me
      right off the limb. I gave a yell and then I landed. Next I knew I was in
      bed. And that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I'll take up the wondrous tale,&rdquo; said Average Jones. &ldquo;The Farleys,
      naturally discomfited by Bailey's abrupt and informal arrival, were in a
      quandary. Here was an inert boy on their hands. He might be dead, which
      would be bad. Or, he might be alive, which would be worse, if they left
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked the Reverend Mr. Prentice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see,&rdquo; explained Average Jones, &ldquo;they couldn't tell how much he
      might have seen and heard before he made his hasty descent. He might have
      enough information to spoil their whole careful and elaborate plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what in the world was their plan?&rdquo; demanded the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That comes later. They took off Bailey's coat and waistcoat, perhaps to
      see if his back was broken (Farley nodded), and finding him alive, tossed
      his clothes into the buggy, where Farley had left his own, and completed
      their necessary work. Of course, there was danger that Bailey might come
      to at any moment and ruin everything. So they worked at top speed, and
      left the final performance to Tuxall. In their excitement they forgot to
      find out from their accomplice who Bailey was. Consequently, they found
      themselves presently driving across country with an unknown and undesired
      white elephant of a boy on their hands. One of them conceived the idea of
      tossing his clothes upon the sea-beach to establish a false clue of
      drowning, until they could decide what was to be done with him. In
      carrying this out they made the mistake which lighted up the whole trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't see it at all,&rdquo; said Farley glumly. &ldquo;How did you ever get
      to us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones mildly contemplated the mathematical center of his
      questioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New waistcoat?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farley glanced down at the outrageous pattern with pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep. Got it last week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lost the one that came with the pepper-and-salt suit you're wearing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn!&rdquo; exploded Farley in sudden enlightenment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so. Your waistcoat got mixed with the boy's clothes, which are of
      the same common pattern, and was tossed out on the beach with his coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I didn't leave a card in it, did I?&rdquo; retorted the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something just as good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ad, Tim!&rdquo; cried the woman. &ldquo;Don't you remember, you couldn't find the
      rough draft you made while we were waiting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right, too,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was in that vest-pocket. But it didn't
      have no name on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, that,&rdquo; put in the Reverend Peter Prentice, &ldquo;was the scrawled
      nonsense&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which you&mdash;er&mdash;threw into the waste-basket,&rdquo; drawled Average
      Jones with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those were not Bailey's clothes at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The coat was his; not the waistcoat. His waistcoat may have fallen out of
      the buggy, or it may be there yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what does all this talk of people at work in the dark, and arson, and
      a mysterious creature tied in a tree lead to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It leads,&rdquo; said Average Jones, &ldquo;to a very large rock, much scorched, and
      with a peculiar carving on it, which now lies imbedded in the earth
      beneath Tuxall's barn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you've seen that,&rdquo; said Farley, &ldquo;it's all up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't seen it. I've inferred it. But it's all up, nevertheless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serves us right,&rdquo; said the woman disgustedly. &ldquo;I wish we'd never heard of
      Tuxall and his line of bunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mystification upon mystification!&rdquo; cried the clergyman. &ldquo;Will some one
      please give a clue to the maze?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a word,&rdquo; said Average Jones. &ldquo;The Harwick meteor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What connection&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, one moment. The 'live thing' in the tree was a captive
      balloon. The box on the ground was a battery. The wire from the battery
      was connected with a firework bomb, which, when Tuxall pressed the switch,
      exploded, releasing a flaming 'dropper.' About the time the 'dropper'
      reached the earth Tuxall lighted up his well-oiled barn. All Harwick,
      having had its attention attracted by the explosion, and seen the portent
      with its own eyes, believed that a huge meteor had fired the building. So
      Tuxall and Company had a well attested wonder from the heavens. That's the
      little plan which Bailey's presence threatened to wreck. Is it your
      opinion that the stars are inhabited, Prentice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the minister, gaping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stars&mdash;inhabited&mdash;living, sentient creatures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd be interested to know, though, wouldn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, certainly. Any one would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly the point. Any one would, and almost any one would pay money to
      see, with his own eye the attested evidence of human, or approximately
      human, life in other spheres. It was a big stake that Tuxall, Farley and
      Company were playing for. Do you begin to see the meaning of the big print
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard nothing about big prints,&rdquo; said the puzzled clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, you've heard but you haven't understood. However, to go on,
      Tuxall and our friends here fixed up a plan on the prospects of a rich
      harvest from public curiosity and credulity. Tuxall planted a big rock
      under the barn, fixed it up appropriately with torch and chisel and sent
      for the Farleys, who are expert firework and balloon people, to
      counterfeit a meteor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amazing!&rdquo; cried the clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a meteor, furthermore, as had never been dreamed of before. If you
      were to visit Tuxall's barn, you would undoubtedly find on the boulder
      underneath it a carving resembling a human form, a hoax more ambitious
      than the Cardiff Giant. He carted the rock in from some quarry and did the
      scorching and carving himself, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you discovered all that in a half-day's visit to Harwick?&rdquo; asked the
      Reverend Mr. Prentice incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but in half-minute's reading of the 'gibberish' which you threw
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taking from the desk the reddish roll which he had brought into the room
      with him, he sent the loose end of it wheeling across the floor, until it
      lay, fully outspread. In black letters against red, the legend glared and
      blared its announcement:
    </p>
    <p>
      MARVELOUS MAN-LIKE MONSTER!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those letters, Mr. Prentice,&rdquo; pursued the Ad-Visor, &ldquo;measure just three
      feet from top to bottom. The phrase 'three feet high' which so puzzled
      you, as combined with the adjectives of great size, was obviously a
      printer's direction. All through the smudged 'copy,' which you threw away,
      there run alliterative lines, 'Stupendous Scientific Sensation,'
      'Veritable Visitor Void' and finally 'Marvelous Man-l&mdash;Monster.' Only
      one trade is irretrievably committed to and indubitably hall-marked by
      alliteration, the circus trade. You'll recall that Farley insensibly fell
      into the habit even in his advertisement; 'lost lad,' 'retained for
      ransom' and 'Mortimer Morley.' Therefore I had the combination circus
      poster, an alleged meteor which burned a barn in a highly suspicious
      manner, and an apparently purposeless kidnapping. The inference was as
      simple as it was certain. The two strangers with Tuxall's aid, had
      prepared the fake meteor with a view to exploiting the star-man. Bailey
      had literally tumbled into the plot. They didn't know how much he had
      seen. The whole affair hinged on his being kept quiet. So they took him
      along. All that I had to do, then, was to find the deviser of the
      three-foot poster. He was sure to be Bailey's abductor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said Farley with conviction, &ldquo;I believe you're the devil's first
      cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you left me in Harwick,&rdquo; said the Reverend Peter Prentice, before
      Average Jones could acknowledge this flattering surmise, &ldquo;you said that
      strangers had done the kidnapping. How did you tell they were strangers
      then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the fact that they didn't know who Bailey was, and had to advertise
      him, indefinitely, as 'lost lad from Harwick.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that there were two of them?&rdquo; pursued the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I surmised two minds: one that schemed out the 'planting' of the clothes
      on the shore; the other, more compassionate, that promulgated the
      advertisement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finally, then, how could you know that Bailey was injured and
      unconscious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he hadn't been unconscious then and for long after, he'd have revealed
      his identity to his captors, wouldn't he?&rdquo; explained the Ad-Visor.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause. Then the woman said timidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and now what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered Average Jones. &ldquo;Tuxall has got away. Mr. Prentice has
      recovered his son. You and Farley have had your lesson. And I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and you, Mr. Detective-man,&rdquo; said the woman, as he paused. &ldquo;What do
      you get out of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones cast an affectionate glance at the sprawling legend which
      disfigured his floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A unique curio in my own special line,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;An ad which never
      has been published and never will be. That's enough for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a double knock at the door, and Mr. Algernon Spofford burst in,
      wearing a face of gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Average,&rdquo; he began, but broke off with a snort of amazement. &ldquo;You've
      found him!&rdquo; cried. &ldquo;Hello, Mr. Prentice. Well, Bailey, alive and kicking,
      eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I've found him and them,&rdquo; replied Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've done better than me, then. I've been through the post-office
      department from the information window here to the postmaster-general in
      Washington, and nobody'll help me find Mortimer Morley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me introduce him; Algy, this is Mortimer Morley; in less private
      life Mr. Tim Farley, and his wife, Mrs. Farley, Mr. Spofford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll be Billy-be-dashed,&rdquo; exploded Mr. Spofford. &ldquo;How did you work
      it out, Average?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the previously enunciated principle,&rdquo; returned Average Jones with a
      smile, &ldquo;that when rats leave a sinking ship or a burning building there's
      usually something behind, worth investigating.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. THE MAN WHO SPOKE LATIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mementoes of Average Jones' exploits in his chosen field hang on the walls
      of his quiet sanctum. Here the favored visitor may see the two red-ink
      dots on a dated sheet of paper, framed in with the card of a chemist and
      an advertised sale of lepidopteroe, which drove a famous millionaire out
      of the country. Near by are displayed the exploitation of a lure for
      black-bass, strangely perforated (a man's reason hung on those
      pin-pricks), and a scrawled legend which seems to spell &ldquo;Mercy&rdquo; (two men's
      lives were sacrificed to that); while below them, set in somber black, is
      the funeral notice of a dog worth a million dollars; facing the call for a
      trombone-player which made a mayor, and the mathematical formula which
      saved a governor. But nowhere does the observer find any record of one of
      the Ad-Visor's most curious cases, running back two thousand years; for
      its owner keeps it in his desk drawer, whence the present chronicler
      exhumed it, by accident, one day. Average Jones has always insisted that
      he scored a failure on this, because, through no possible fault of his
      own, he was unable to restore a document of the highest historical and
      literary importance. Of that, let the impartial reader judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was while Average Jones was waiting for a break of that deadlock of
      events which, starting from the flat-dweller with the poisoned face,
      finally worked out the strange fate of Telfik Bey, that he sat, one
      morning, breakfasting late. The cool and breezy inner portico of the
      Cosmic Club, where small tables overlook a gracious fountain shimmering
      with the dart and poise of goldfish, was deserted save for himself, a
      summer-engagement star actor, a specialist in carbo-hydrates, and a famous
      adjuster of labor troubles; the four men being fairly typical of the
      club's catholicity of membership. Contrary to his impeccant habit, Average
      Jones bore the somewhat frazzled aspect of a man who has been up all
      night. Further indication of this inhered in the wide yawn, of which he
      was in mid-enjoyment, when a hand on his shoulder cut short his ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to interrupt so valuable an exercise,&rdquo; said a languid voice. &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
       and the voice stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Bert,&rdquo; returned the Ad-Visor, looking up at the faultlessly clad
      slenderness of his occasional coadjutor, Robert Bertram. &ldquo;Sit down and
      keep me awake till the human snail who's hypothetically ministering to my
      wants can get me some coffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What particular phase of intellectual debauchery have you been up to
      now?&rdquo; inquired Bertram, lounging into the chair opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trying to forget my troubles by chasing up a promising lead which failed
      to pan, out. 'Wanted: a Tin Nose,' sounds pretty good, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is music to my untutored ear,&rdquo; answered Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it turned out to be merely an error of the imbecile, or perhaps
      facetious printer, who sets up the Trumpeter's personal column. It should
      have read, 'Wanted&mdash;a Tea Rose.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even that seems far from commonplace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a code summons for a meeting of the Rosicrucians. I suppose you know
      that the order has been revived here in America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the true Rosicrucians, surely!&rdquo; said Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They pretend to be. A stupid lot who make child's play of it,&rdquo; said
      Average Jones impatiently. &ldquo;Never mind them. I'd rather know what's on
      your mind. You made an observation when you came in, rather more
      interesting than your usual output of table-talk. You said 'but' and
      nothing further. The conjunction 'but,' in polite grammar, ordinarily has
      a comet-like tail to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apropos of polite grammar, do you speak Latin?&rdquo; asked Bertram carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not enough to be gossipy in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you wouldn't care to give a job to a man who can't speak anything
      else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On that qualification alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o, not entirely. He is a good military engineer, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that's the other end of the 'but,' is it?&rdquo; said Average Jones. &ldquo;Go on.
      Elaborate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram laid before his friend a printed clipping in clear, large type,
      saying: &ldquo;When I read this, I couldn't resist the notion that somehow or
      other it was in your line; pursuit of the adventure of life, and all that.
      Let's see what you make of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones straightened in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Latin!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And an ad, by the look of it. Can our blind friend, J.
      Alden Honeywell, have taken to the public prints?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly, I think. This is from the Classical Weekly, a Baltimore
      publication of small and select patronage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm. Looks ra-a-a-ather alluring,&rdquo; commented Average Jones with a
      prolonged drawl. &ldquo;Better than the Rosicrucian fakery, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent over the clipping, studying these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. Livius M. F. Praenestinus, quodlibet in negotium non inhonestum qui
      victum meream locare ve lim. Litteratus sum; scriptum facere bene scio.
      Stipendia multa emeritus, scientiarum belli, prasertim muniendi, sum
      peritus. Hac de re pro me spondebit M. Agrippa. Latine tantum solo. Siquis
      me velit convenire, quovis die mane adesto in publicis hortis urbis
      Baltimorianae ad signum apri.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you make it out?&rdquo; asked Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm-m-m. Well&mdash;the general sense. Livius seems to yearn in modern
      print for any honest employment, but especially scrapping of the ancient
      variety or secretarying. Apply to Agrippa for references. Since he
      describes his conversation as being confined to Latin, I take it he won't
      find many jobs reaching out eagerly for him. Anybody who wants him can
      find him in the Park of the Wild Boar in Baltimore. That's about what I
      make of it. Now, what's his little lay, I wonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some lay of Ancient Rome, anyhow,&rdquo; suggested Bertram. &ldquo;Association with
      Agrippa would put him back in the first century, B. C., wouldn't it?
      Besides, my informant tells me that Mr. Livius, who seems to have been an
      all-around sort of person, helped organize fire brigades for Crassus, and
      was one of the circle of minor poets who wrote rhapsodies to the fair but
      frail Clodia's eyebrows, ear-lobes and insteps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your informant? The man's actually been seen, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Yes. He's on view as per advertisement, I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones rose and stretched his well-knit frame. &ldquo;Baltimore will be
      hotter than the Place-as-Isn't,&rdquo; he said plaintively. &ldquo;Martyrdom by fire!
      However, I'm off by the five-o'clock train. I'll let you know if anything
      special comes of it, Bert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barye's splendid bronze boar couches, semi-shaded, in the center of
      Monument Park, Baltimore's social hill-top. There Average lounged and
      strolled through the longest hour of a glaring July morning. People came
      and went; people of all degrees and descriptions, none of whom suggested
      in any particular the first century, B. C. One individual only maintained
      any permanency of situation. He was a gaunt, powerful, freckled man of
      thirty who sprawled on a settee and regarded Average Jones with obvious
      and amused interest. In time this annoyed the Ad-Visor, who stopped short,
      facing the settee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's gone,&rdquo; said the freckled man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning Livius, the Roman?&rdquo; asked Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. Lucius Livius, son of Marcus Praenestinus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the representative of this rather peculiar person, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a dull world, except for peculiar persons,&rdquo; observed the man
      on the settee philosophically. &ldquo;I've seen very many peculiar persons
      lately by the simple process of coming here day after day. No, I'm not Mr.
      Livius' representative. I'm only a town-bound and interested observer of
      his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you've got the better of me,&rdquo; said Average Jones. &ldquo;I was rather
      anxious to see him myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other looked speculatively at the trim, keen-faced young man. &ldquo;Yet you
      do not look like a Latin scholar,&rdquo; he observed; &ldquo;if you'll pardon the
      comment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor do you,&rdquo; retorted Jones; &ldquo;if the apology is returnable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; owned the other with a sigh. &ldquo;I've often thought that my
      classical capacity would gain more recognition if I didn't have a skin
      like Bob Fitzsimmons and hands like Ty Cobb. Nevertheless, I'm in and of
      the department of Latin of Johns Hopkins University. Name, Warren. Sit
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Name, Jones. Profession, advertising advisor.
      Object, curiosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A. V. R. E. Jones; better known as Average Jones, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Experto crede! Being dog Latin for 'You seem to know all about it.&rdquo;' The
      new-comer eyed his vis-a-vis. &ldquo;Perhaps you&mdash;er&mdash;know Mr. Robert
      Bertram,&rdquo; he drawled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oculus&mdash;the eye&mdash;tauri&mdash;of the bull. Bull's eye!&rdquo; said the
      freckled one, with a grin. &ldquo;I'd heard of your exploits through Bertram,
      and thought probably you'd follow the bait contained in my letter to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing wrong with your nerve-system, is there?&rdquo; inquired Average Jones
      with mock anxiety. &ldquo;Now that I'm here, where is L. Livius. And so forth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elegantly but uncomfortably housed with Colonel Ridgway Graeme in his
      ancestral barrack on Carteret Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this Colonel Graeme a friend of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend and&mdash;foe, tried and true. We meet twice a week, usually at
      his house, to squabble over his method of Latin pronunciation and his
      construction of the ablative case. He's got a theory of the ablative
      absolute,&rdquo; said Warren with a scowl, &ldquo;fit to fetch Tacitus howling from
      the shades.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A scholar, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very fine and finished scholar, though a faddist of the rankest type.
      Speaks Latin as readily as he does English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over seventy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in money. Taxes on his big place keep him pinched; that and his
      passion for buying all kinds of old and rare books. He's got, perhaps an
      income of five thousand, clear, of which about three thousand goes in book
      auctions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Lives with two ancient colored servants who look after him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did our friend from B. C. connect up with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he ran to the old colonel like a chick to its hen. You see, there
      aren't so very many Latinists in town during the hot weather. Perhaps
      eighteen or twenty in all came from about here and from Washington to see
      the prodigy in 'the Park of the Boar,' after the advertisement appeared.
      He wouldn't have anything to do with any of us. Pretended he didn't
      understand our kind of Latin. I offered him a place, myself, at a wage of
      more denarii than I could well afford. I wanted a chance to study him.
      Then came the colonel and fairy grabbed him. So I sent for you&mdash;in my
      artless professional way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why such enthusiasm on the part of Colonel Graeme?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simple enough. Livius spoke Latin with in accent which bore out the old
      boy's contention. I believe they also agreed on the ablative absolute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;er&mdash;naturally,&rdquo; drawled Average Jones. &ldquo;Does our early
      Roman speak pretty ready Latin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's fairly fluent. Sometimes he stumbles a little on his constructions,
      and he's apt to be&mdash;well&mdash;monkish&mdash;rather than classical
      when in full course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn't wear the toga virilis, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. Plain American clothes. It's only his inner man that's Roman, of
      course. He met with bump on the head&mdash;this is his story, and he's got
      a the scar to show for it&mdash;and when he came to, he'd lost ground a
      couple of thousand years and returned to his former existence. No English.
      No memory of who or what he'd been. No money connection whatsoever with
      the living world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Wonder if he's been a student of Kippling. You remember 'The
      Greatest Story in the World; the reincarnated galley slave?' Now as to
      this Colonel Graeme; has he ever published?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Two small pamphlets, issued by the Classicist Press, which publishes
      the Classical Weekly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supporting his fads, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right. He devoted one pamphlet to each.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones contemplated with absorbed attention an ant which was making
      a laborious spiral ascent of his cane. Not until it had gained a vantage
      point on the bone handle did he speak again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Professor Warren: I'm a passionate devotee of the Latin tongue.
      I have my deep and dark suspicions of our present modes of pronunciation,
      all three of 'em. As for the ablative absolute, its reconstruction and
      regeneration have been the inspiring principle of my studious manhood.
      Humbly I have sat at the feet of Learning, enshrined in the Ridgway Graeme
      pamphlets. I must meet Colonel Graeme&mdash;after reading the pamphlets. I
      hope they're not long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Warren frowned. &ldquo;Colonel Graeme is a gentleman and my friend, Mr. Jones,&rdquo;
       he said with emphasis. &ldquo;I won't have him made a butt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shan't be, by me,&rdquo; said Average Jones quietly. &ldquo;Has it perhaps struck
      you, as his friend, that&mdash;er&mdash;a close daily association with the
      psychic remnant of a Roman citizen might conceivably be non-conducive to
      his best interest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it has. I see your point. You want to approach him on his weak side.
      But, have you Latin enough to sustain the part? He's shrewd as a weasel in
      all matters of scholarship, though a child whom any one could fool in
      practical affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I haven't,&rdquo; admitted Average Jones. &ldquo;Therefore, I'm a mute. A shock
      in early childhood paralyzed my centers of speech. I talk to you by sign
      language, and you interpret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I hardly know the deaf-mute alphabet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I. But I'll waggle my fingers like lightning if he says anything to
      me requiring an answer, and you'll give the proper reply. Does Colonel
      Graeme implicitly credit the Romanism of his guest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does, because he wants to. To have an educated man of the classic
      period of the Latin tongue, a friend of Caesar, an auditor of Cicero and a
      contemporary of Virgil, Horace and Ovid come back and speak in the accent
      he's contended for, make a powerful support for his theories. He's at work
      on a supplementary thesis already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do the other Latin men who've seen Livius, think of the
      metempsychosis claim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don't know. Livius explained his remote antecedents only after he
      had got Colonel Graeme's private ear. The colonel has kept it quiet.
      'Don't want a rabble of psychologists and soul-pokers worrying him to
      death,' he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Making it pretty plain sailing for the Roman. Well, arrange to take me
      there as soon as possible.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Graeme house, Average Jones was received with simple courtesy by a
      thin rosy-cheeked old gentleman with a dagger-like imperial and a dreamy
      eye, who, on Warren's introduction, made him free of the unkempt old
      place's hospitality. They conversed for a time, Average Jones maintaining
      his end with nods and gestures, and (ostensibly) through the digital
      mediumship of his sponsor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Warren said to the host:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is your visitor from the past?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prowling among my books,&rdquo; answered the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we not going to see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonel looked a little embarrassed. &ldquo;The fact is, Professor Warren,
      Livius has taken rather an aversion to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry. How so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A twinkle of malice shone in the old scholar's eye. &ldquo;He says your Latin
      accent frets his nerves,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Warren, obeying a quick signal from his accomplice,
      &ldquo;I'll stroll in the garden, while you present Mr. Jones to Livius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Graeme led the way to a lofty wing, once used as a drawing-room,
      but now the repository for thousands of books, which not only filled the
      shelves but were heaped up in every corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must apologize for this confusion, sir,&rdquo; said the host. &ldquo;No one is
      permitted to arrange my books but myself. And my efforts, I fear, serve
      only to make confusion more confounded. There are four other rooms even
      more chaotic than this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of his voice a man who had been seated behind a tumulus of
      volumes rose and stood. Average Jones looked at him keenly. He was perhaps
      forty-five years of age, thin and sinewy, with a close-shaven face, pale
      blue eyes, and a narrow forehead running high into a mop of grizzled
      locks. Diagonally across the front part of the scalp a scar could be dimly
      perceived through the hair. Average Jones glanced at the stranger's hands,
      to gain, if possible, some hint of his former employment. With his faculty
      of swift observation, he noticed that the long, slender fingers were not
      only mottled with dust, but also scuffed, and, in places, scarified, as if
      their owner had been hurriedly handling a great number of books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Graeme presented the new-comer in formal Latin. He bowed. The
      scarred man made a curious gesture of the hand, addressing Average Jones
      in an accent which, even to the young man's long-unaccustomed cars,
      sounded strange and strained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Di illi linguam astrinxere; mutus est,&rdquo; said Colonel Graeme, indicating
      the younger man, and added a sentence in sonorous metrical Greek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones recalled the Aeschylean line. &ldquo;Well, though 'a great ox hath
      stepped on my tongue,' it hasn't trodden out my eyes, praises be!&rdquo; said he
      to himself as he caught the uneasy glance of the Roman.
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of allaying suspicion, he scribbled upon a sheet of paper a few
      complimentary Latin sentences, in which Warren had sedulously coached him
      for the occasion, and withdrew to the front room, where he was presently
      joined by the Johns Hopkins man. Fortunately, the colonel gave them a few
      moments together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrange for me to come here daily to study in the library,&rdquo; whispered
      Jones to the Latin professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sit tight,&rdquo; added Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped, soft-footed, on the thick old rug, across to the library door
      and threw it open. Just inside stood Livius, an expression of startled
      anger on his thin face. Quickly recovering himself, he explained, in his
      ready Latin, that he was about to enter and speak to his patron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shows a remarkable interest in possible conversation,&rdquo; whispered Jones,
      on his withdrawal, &ldquo;for a man who understands no English. Also does me the
      honor to suspect me. He must have been a wily chap&mdash;in the Consulship
      of Plancus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before leaving, Average Jones had received from Colonel Graeme a general
      invitation to spend as much time as he chose, studying among the books.
      The old man-servant, Saul, had orders to admit him at any hour. He
      returned to his hotel to write a courteous note of acknowledgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many hours has Average Jones spent more tediously than those passed in the
      cool seclusion of Colonel Ridgway Graeme's treasure-house of print. He
      burrowed among quaint accumulations of forgotten classics. He dipped with
      astonishment into the savage and ultra-Rabelaisian satire of Von Hutter's
      &ldquo;Epistola, Obscurorum Virorumf&rdquo; which set early sixteenth century Europe
      a-roar with laughter at the discomfited monks; and he cleansed himself
      from that tainted atmosphere in the fresh air and free English of a
      splendid Audubon &ldquo;first&rdquo;&mdash;and all the time he was conscious that the
      Roman watched, watched, watched. More than, once Livius offered aid,
      seeking to apprise himself of the supposed mute's line of investigation;
      but the other smilingly fended him off. At the end of four days, Average
      Jones had satisfied himself that if Livius were seeking anything in
      particular, he had an indefinite task before him, for the colonel's bound
      treasures were in indescribable confusion. Apparently he had bought from
      far and near, without definite theme or purpose. As he bought he read, and
      having read, cast aside; and where a volume fell, there it had license to
      lie. No cataloguer had ever sought to restore order to that bibliographic
      riot. To seek any given book meant a blind voyage, without compass or
      chart, throughout the mingled centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often Colonel Graeme spent hours in one or the other of the huge
      book-rooms talking with his strange protege and making copious notes.
      Usually the old gentleman questioned and the other answered. But one
      morning the attitude seemed, to the listening Ad-Visor, to be reversed.
      Livius, in the far corner of the room, was speaking in a low tone. To
      judge from the older man's impatient manner the Roman was interrupting his
      host's current of queries with interrogations of his own. Average Jones
      made a mental note, and, in conference with Warren that evening, asked him
      to ascertain from Colonel Graeme whether Livius's inquiries had indicated
      a specific interest in any particular line of reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following day, however, an event of more immediate import occupied
      his mind. He had spent the morning in the up-stairs library, at the
      unevadable suggestion of Colonel Graeme, while the colonel and his Roman
      collogued below. Coming down about noon, Average Jones entered the
      colonel's small study just in time to see Livius, who was alone in the
      room, turn away sharply from the desk. His elbow was held close to his
      ribs in a peculiar manner. He was concealing something under his coat.
      With a pretense of clumsiness, Average Jones stumbled against him in
      passing. Livius drew away, his high forehead working with suspicion. The
      Ad-Visor's expression of blank apology, eked out with a bow and a grimace,
      belied the busy-working mind within. For, in the moment's contact, he had
      heard the crisp rustle of paper from beneath the ill-fitting coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      What paper had the man from B. C. taken furtively from his benefactor's
      table? It must be large; otherwise he could have readily thrust it into
      his pocket. No sooner was Livius out of the room than Average Jones
      scanned the desk. His face lighted with a sudden smile. Colonel Graeme
      never read a newspaper; boasted, in fact, that he wouldn't have one about
      the place. But, as Average Jones distinctly recalled, he had, himself,
      that very morning brought, in a copy of the Globe and dropped it into the
      scrap basket near the writing-table. It was gone. Livius had taken it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he's got the newspaper-reading habit,&rdquo; said Average Jones to himself,
      &ldquo;I'll set a trap for him. But Warren must furnish the bait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went to look up his aide. The conference between them was long and
      exhaustive, covering the main points of the case from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you find out from Colonel Graeme,&rdquo; inquired Average Jones, &ldquo;whether
      Livius, affected any particular brand of literature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He seems to be specializing on late seventeenth century British
      classicism. Apparently he considers that the flower of British scholarship
      of that time wrote a very inferior kind of dog Latin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Late seventeenth century Latinity,&rdquo; commented Average Jones. &ldquo;That&mdash;er&mdash;gives,
      us a fair start. Now as to the body-servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Saul? I questioned him about strange callers. He said he remembered
      only two, besides an occasional peddler or agent. They were looking for
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inside the house. One wanted to catalogue the library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he look like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saul says he wore glasses and a worse tall hat than the colonel's and had
      a full beard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bookbinder and repairer. Wanted to fix up Colonel Graeme's collection.
      Youngish, smartly dressed, with a small waxed moustache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And our Livius is clean-shaven,&rdquo; murmured Average Jones. &ldquo;How long apart
      did they call?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About two weeks. The second applicant came on the day of the last
      snowfall. I looked that up. It was March 27.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, Warren,&rdquo; observed Average Jones, &ldquo;I sometimes think that
      part of your talents, at least, are wasted in a chair of Latin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, there is more excitement in this hide-and-seek game, as you
      play it, than in the pursuits of a musty pedant,&rdquo; admitted the other,
      crackling his large knuckles. &ldquo;But when are we going to spring upon friend
      Livius and strip him of his fake toga?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the easiest part of it. I've already caught him filling a
      fountain-pen as if he'd been brought up on them, and humming the spinning
      chorus from The Flying Dutchman; not to mention the lifting of my
      newspaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nemo mortalium omnibus horis sapit,&rdquo; murmured Warren.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. As you say, no fellow can be on the job all the time. But our problem
      is not to catch Livius, but to find out what it is he's been after for the
      last three months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three months? You're assuming that it was he who applied for work in the
      library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. And when he failed at that he set about a very carefully
      developed scheme to get at Colonel Graeme's books anyway. By inquiries he
      found out the old gentleman's fad and proceeded to get in training for it.
      You don't know, perhaps, that I have a corps of assistants who clip,
      catalogue and file all unusual advertisements. Here is one which they
      turned up for me on my order to send me any queer educational
      advertisements: 'Wanted&mdash;Daily lessons in Latin speech from competent
      Spanish scholar. Write, Box 347, Banner office.' That is from the New York
      Banner of April third, shortly after the strange caller's second abortive
      attempt to get into the Graeme library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose our Livius figured out that Colonel Graeme's theory of accent
      was about what a Spaniard would have. But he couldn't have learned all his
      Latin in four months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn't. He was a scholar already; an accomplished one, who went wrong
      through drink and became a crook, specializing in rare books and prints.
      His name is Enderby; you'll find it in the Harvard catalogue. He's
      supposed to be dead. My assistant traced him through his Spanish-Latin
      teacher, a priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But even allowing for his scholarship, he must have put in a deal of work
      perfecting himself in readiness of speech and accent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he did. Therefore the prize must be big. A man of Enderby's caliber
      doesn't concoct a scheme of such ingenuity, and go into bondage with it,
      for nothing. Do you belong to the Cosmic Club?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The assistant professor stared. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to put you up there. One advantage of membership is that its
      roster includes experts in every known line of erudition, from scarabs to
      skeeing. For example, I am now going to telegraph for aid from old
      Millington, who seldom misses a book auction and is a human bibliography
      of the wanderings of all rare volumes. I'm going to find out from him what
      British publication of the late seventeenth century in Latin is very
      valuable; also what volumes of that time have changed hands in the last
      six months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Graeme went to a big book auction in New York early in March,&rdquo;
       volunteered Warren, &ldquo;but he told me he didn't pick up anything of
      particular value.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it's something he doesn't know about and Livius does. I'm going to
      take advantage of our Roman's rather un-B.-C.-like habit of reading the
      daily papers by trying him out with this advertisement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones wrote rapidly and tossed the result to his coadjutor who
      read:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;LOST&mdash;Old book printed in Latin.  Buff
     leather binding, a little faded ('It's safe to be
     that,' explained Average Jones).  No great
     value except to owner.  Return to Colonel
     Ridgway Graeme, 11 Carteret Street, and
     receive reward.&rdquo;

      The advertisement made its appearance in big type on the front pages of
      the Baltimore paper of the following day. That evening Average Jones met
      Warren, for dinner, with a puckered brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Livius rise to the bait?&rdquo; asked the scholar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he!&rdquo; chuckled Average Jones. &ldquo;He's been nervous as a cat all day and
      hardly has looked at the library. But what puzzles me is this.&rdquo; He
      exhibited a telegram from New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Millington says positively no book of that time and description any great
      value. Enderby at Barclay auction in March and made row over some book
      which he missed because it was put up out of turn in catalogue. Barclay
      auctioneer thinks it was one of Percival privately bound books 1680-1703.
      Am anonymous book of Percival library, De Meritis Librorum Britannorum,
      was sold to Colonel Graeme for $47, a good price. When do I get in on
      this?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;(Signed), ROBERT BERTRAM.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that treatise,&rdquo; said Warren. &ldquo;It isn't particularly rare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones stared at the telegram in silence. Finally he drawled:
      &ldquo;There are&mdash;er&mdash;books and&mdash;er&mdash;books&mdash;and&mdash;er&mdash;things
      in books. Wait here for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three hours later he reappeared with collar wilted, but spirits elate, and
      abruptly announced:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Warren, I'm a cobbler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cobbler. Mend your boots, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in earnest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Haven't you ever remarked that a serious-minded earnestness
      always goes with cobbling? Though I'm not really a practical cobbler, but
      a proprietary one. Our friend, Bertram, will dress and act the practical
      part. I've wired him and he's replied, collect, accepting the job. You and
      I will be in the background.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;NO. 27 Jasmine Street. Not a very savory locality. Why is it, Warren,
      that the beauty of a city street is generally in inverse ratio to the
      poetic quality of its name? There I've hired the shop and stock of Mr.
      Hans Fichtel for two days, at the handsome rental of ten dollars per day.
      Mr. Fichtel purposes to take a keg of beer a-fishing. I think two days
      will be enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the keg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that noble Roman, Livius. He'll be reading the papers pretty keenly
      now. And in to-morrow's, he'll find this advertisement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones read from a sheet of paper which he took from his pocket:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;FOUND&mdash;Old book in foreign language, probably
     Latin, marked 'Percival.'  Owner may recover by
     giving satisfactory description of peculiar and obscure
     feature and refunding for advertisement. Fichtel,
     27 Jasmine Street.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the peculiar and obscure feature, Jones?&rdquo; asked Warren.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know there is any?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must be something peculiar about the book or Enderby wouldn't put in four
      months of work on the chance of stealing it. And it must be obscure,
      otherwise the auctioneer would have spotted it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sound enough!&rdquo; approved the other. &ldquo;What could it be? Some interpolated
      page?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly. I've a treatise in my pocket on seventeenth century book-making,
      which I'm going to study to-night. Be ready for an early start to meet
      Bertram.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That languid and elegant gentleman arrived by the first morning train. He
      protested mightily when he was led to the humble shoe-shop. He protested
      more mightily when invited to don a leather apron and smudge his face
      appropriately to his trade. His protests, waxing vehement and eventually
      profane, as he barked his daintily-kept fingers, in rehearsal for giving a
      correct representation of an honest artisan cobbling a boot, died away
      when Average Jones explained to him that on pretense of having found a
      rare book, he was to worm out of a cautious and probably suspicious
      criminal the nature of some unique and hidden feature of the volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust me for diplomacy,&rdquo; said Bertram airily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will because I've got to,&rdquo; retorted Average Jones. &ldquo;Well, get to work.
      To you the outer shop: to Warren and me this rear room. And, remember, if
      you hear me whetting a knife, that means come at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uncomfortably twisted into a supposedly professional posture, Bertram
      wrought with hammer and last, while putting off, with lame, blind and
      halting, excuses, such as came to call for their promised footgear. By a
      triumph of tact he had just disposed of a rancid-tongued female who
      demanded her husband's boots, a satisfactory explanation, or the
      arbitrament of the lists, when the bell tinkled and the two watchers in
      the back room heard a nervous, cultivated voice say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Fichtel here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's me,&rdquo; said Bertram, landing an agonizing blow on his thumb-nail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You advertised that you had found an old book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Somebody left it in the post-office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah; that must have been when I went to mail some letters to New York,&rdquo;
       said the other glibly. &ldquo;From the advertised description, the book is
      without doubt mine. Now as to the reward&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, but you wouldn't expect me to give it up without any
      identification, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. It was the De Meritis Libror&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't read Latin, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you could make that much out,&rdquo; said the visitor with rising
      exasperation. &ldquo;Come; if it's a matter of the reward&mdash;how much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't mind having a good reward; say ten dollars. But I want to be
      sure it's your book. There's something about it that you could easily tell
      me sir, for any one could see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very observing shoemaker,&rdquo; commented the other with a slight sneer.
      &ldquo;You mean the&mdash;the half split cover?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swish-swish; whish-swish,&rdquo; sounded from the rear room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Bertram, who had not ceased from his pretended work. &ldquo;I
      have to get a piece of leather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped into the back room where Average Jones, his face alight, held
      up a piece of paper upon which he had hurriedly scrawled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mss. bound into cover. Get it out of him. Tell him you've a brother who
      is a Latin scholar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram nodded, caught up a strip of calf-skin and returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the split cover and what's inside?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other started. &ldquo;You didn't get it out?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You didn't tear
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. It's there safe enough. But some of it can be made out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you didn't read Latin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; but I have a brother that went through the Academy. He reads a
      little.&rdquo;' This was thin ice, but Bertram went forward with assumed
      assurance. &ldquo;He thinks the manuscript is quite rare. Oh, Fritz! Come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any letter of Bacon's is rare, of course,&rdquo; returned the other
      impatiently. &ldquo;Therefore, I purpose offering you fifty dollars reward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up as Average Jones entered. The young man's sleeves were rolled
      up, his face was generously smudged, and a strip of cobbler's wax beneath
      the tipper lip, puffed and distorted the firm line of his mouth. Further,
      his head was louting low on his neck, so that the visitor got no view
      sufficient for recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Bacon's letter&mdash;er&mdash;must be pretty rare, Mister,&rdquo; he
      drawled thickly. &ldquo;But a letter&mdash;er&mdash;from Lord Bacon&mdash;er&mdash;about
      Shakespeare&mdash;that ought to be worth a lot of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones had taken his opening with his customary incisive
      shrewdness. The mention of Bacon had settled it, to his mind. Only one
      imaginable character of manuscript from the philosopher scholar-politician
      could have value enough to tempt a thief of Enderby's calibre. Enderby's
      expression told that the shot was a true one. As for Bertram, he had
      dropped his shoemaker's knife and his shoemaker's role.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bacon on Shakespeare! Shades of the departed glory of Ignatius Donnelly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitor drew back. Warren's gaunt frame appeared in the doorway.
      Jones' head lifted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to be as&mdash;er&mdash;unique,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;as an&mdash;er&mdash;Ancient
      Roman speaking perfect English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like a flash, the false Livius caught up the knife from the bench where
      the false cobbler had dropped it and swung toward Average Jones. At the
      moment the ample hand of Professor Warren, bunched into a highly competent
      fist, flicked across and caught the assailant under the ear. Enderby,
      alias Livius, fell as if smitten by a cestus. As his arm touched the
      floor, Average Jones kicked unerringly at the wrist and the knife flew and
      tinkled in a far corner. Bertram, with a bound, landed on the fallen man's
      chest and pinned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Did he get you, Average?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not&mdash;er&mdash;this time. Pretty good&mdash;er&mdash;team work,&rdquo;
       drawled the Ad-Visor. &ldquo;We've got our man for felonious assault, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Enderby, panting under Bertram's solid knee, blinked and struggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use, Livius,&rdquo; said Average Jones. &ldquo;Might as well quiet down and
      confess. Ease up a little on him, Bert. Take a look at that scar of his
      first though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Superficial cut treated with make-up paint; a clever job,&rdquo; pronounced
      Bertram after a quick examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I supposed,&rdquo; said Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me in on the deal,&rdquo; pleaded Livius. &ldquo;That letter is worth ten
      thousand, twelve thousand, fifteen thousand dollars&mdash;anything you
      want to ask, if you find the right purchaser. And you can't manage it
      without me. Let me in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinks we're crooks, too?&rdquo; remarked Average Jones. &ldquo;Exactly what's in
      this wonderful letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's from Bacon to the author of the book, who wrote about 1610. Bacon
      prophesies that Shakespeare, 'this vagabond and humble mummer' would
      outshine and outlive in fame all the genius of his time. That's all I
      could make out by loosening the stitches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is worth anything one could demand,&rdquo; said Warren in a somewhat
      awed tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you get the letter when you were examining it at the auction
      room?&rdquo; inquired Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some fool of a binder had overlooked the double cover, and sewed it in. I
      noticed it at the auction, gummed the opening together while no one was
      watching, and had gone to get cash to buy the book; but the auctioneer put
      it up out of turn and old Graeme got it. Bring it to me and I'll show you
      the 'pursed' cover. Many of the Percival books were bound that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've never had it, nor seen it,&rdquo;' replied Average Jones. &ldquo;The
      advertisement was only a trap into which you stepped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Enderby's jaw dropped. &ldquo;Then it's still at the Graeme house,&rdquo; he cried,
      beating on the floor with his free hand. &ldquo;Take me back there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we'll take you,&rdquo; said Warren grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close-packed among them in a cab, they drove him back to Carteret Street.
      Colonel Ridgway Graeme was at home and greeted them courteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've found Livius,&rdquo; he said, with relief. &ldquo;I had begun to fear for
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Graeme,&rdquo; began Average Jones, &ldquo;you have&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Speech!&rdquo; cried the old gentleman. &ldquo;And you a mute! What does this
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind him,&rdquo; broke in Enderby Livius. &ldquo;There's something more
      important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the colonel had shrunk back. &ldquo;English from you, Livius!&rdquo; he cried,
      setting his hand to his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All will be explained in time, Colonel,&rdquo; Warren assured him. &ldquo;Meanwhile,
      you have a document of the utmost importance and value. Do you remember
      buying one of the Percival volumes at the Barclay auction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The collector drew his brows down in an effort to remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An octavo, in fairly good condition?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; cried Enderby eagerly. &ldquo;Where is it? What did you do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was in Latin&mdash;very false Latin.&rdquo; The four men leaned forward,
      breathless. &ldquo;Oh, I remember. It slipped from my pocket and fell into the
      river as I was crossing the ferry to Jersey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a dead, flat, stricken silence. Then Average Jones turned hollow
      eyes upon Warren.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Professor,&rdquo; he said, with a rueful attempt at a smile, &ldquo;what's the past
      participle, passive, plural, of the Latin verb, 'to sting'?&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER X. THE ONE BEST BET
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morrison has jammed the Personal Liberty bill through,&rdquo; said Waldemar,
      scrawling a head on his completed editorial, with one eye on the clock,
      which pointed to midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was to be expected, wasn't it?&rdquo; asked Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; replied the editor-owner of the Universal in his heavy bass.
      &ldquo;And now the governor announces he will veto it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thereby bringing the whole power of the gambling ring down on him like an
      avalanche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. Morrison has declared open war against 'Pharisee Phil,' as he
      calls Governor Arthur. Says he'll pass the bill over his veto. In his
      heart he knows he can't do it. Still, he's a hard fighter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones tipped his chair back against the wall of the editorial
      sanctum. &ldquo;What do you suppose,&rdquo; he inquired with an air of philosophic
      speculation, &ldquo;that the devil will do with Carroll Morrison's soul when he
      gets it? Deodorize it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harsh words, young sir! Harsh words and treasonable against one of our
      leading citizens; multimillionaire philanthropist, social leader, director
      of banks, insurance companies and railroads, and emperor of the
      race-track, the sport of kings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sport of kings-maintained on the spoils of clerks,&rdquo; retorted Average
      Jones. &ldquo;'To improve the breed of horses,' if you please! To make thieves
      of men and harlots of women, because Carroll Morrison must have his
      gambling-game dividends! And now he has our 'representative' legislature
      working for him to that honorable end!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man to see you, Mr. Waldemar,&rdquo; said an office boy, appearing at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; grunted the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says it's very particular, sir, and to tell you it's something Mr.
      Morrison is interested in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morrison, eh? All right. Just step into the inner office, will you,
      Jones? Leave the door open. There might be something interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had Average Jones found a chair in the darkened office when the
      late caller appeared. He was middle-aged, pursy, and dressed with
      slap-dash ostentation. His face was bloated and seared with excesses. But
      it was not intoxication that sweated on his forehead and quivered in his
      jaw. It was terror. He slumped into the waiting chair and mouthed mutely
      at the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; The bullet-like snap of the interrogation stung the man into
      babbling speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'S like this, Misser Wald'mar. 'S like this. Y-y-yuh see, 's like this.
      Fer Gawsake, kill out an ad for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? In to-morrow's paper? Nonsense! You're too late, even if I wished
      to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitor stood up and dug both hands into his side pockets. He
      produced, first a binocular, which, with a snarl, he flung upon the floor.
      Before it had stopped bumping, there fluttered down upon the seat of his
      chair a handful of greenbacks. Another followed, and another, and another.
      The bills toppled and spread, and some of them slid to the floor. Still
      the man delved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he panted at last. &ldquo;Money talks. There's the stuff. Count it.
      Eighteen hundred if there's a dollar. More likely two thou. If that ain't
      enough, make your own price. I don't care what it is. Make it, Misser. Put
      a price on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something loathsome and obscene in the creature's gibbering flux
      of words. The editor leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bribery, eh?&rdquo; he inquired softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man flinched from the tone. &ldquo;It ain't bribery, is it, to ast you to
      rout out jus' one line from an ad an' pay you for the trouble. My own ad,
      too. If it runs, it's my finish. I was nutty when I wrote it. Fer Gawsake,
      Misser&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop it! You say Morrison sent you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. Not exac'ly. 'S like this, M' Wald'mar. I hadda get to you some
      way. It's important to Misser Morrison, too. But he don't know I come. He
      don't know nothing about it. Oh, Gaw! If he finds out&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put that money back in your pockets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an ashen face of despair, the man obeyed. As he finished, he began to
      sag at the joints. Slowly he slackened down until he was on his knees, an
      abject spectacle of disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand up,&rdquo; ordered Waldemar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Liss'n; liss'n t' me,&rdquo; moaned the man. &ldquo;I'll make it three thousand. Fi'
      thou&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The editor's hearty grip on his coat collar heaved the creature to his
      feet. For a moment he struggled, panting, then spun, helpless and headlong
      from the room, striking heavily against the passage wall outside. There
      was a half-choked groan; then his footsteps slumped away into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; grunted Waldemar. &ldquo;Come back, Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones reentered. &ldquo;Have you no curiosity in your composition?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much&mdash;having been reared in the newspaper business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stooping, Average Jones picked up the glasses which the man had thrown on
      the floor and examined them carefully. &ldquo;Rather a fine instrument,&rdquo; he
      observed. &ldquo;Marked N. K. I think I'll follow up the owner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll never find him now. He has too much start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. When a man is in his state of abject funk, it's ten to one he
      lands at the nearest bar. Wait for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fifteen minutes Average Jones was back. There was a curious expression
      on his face as he nodded an assent to his friend's inquiring eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Waldemar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the floor of a Park Row saloon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead drunk, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;er; not&mdash;er&mdash;drunk. Dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Waldemar stiffened in his chair. &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poison, probably. The ad was his finish, as he said. The next thing is to
      find it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first edition will be down any minute now. But it'll take some
      finding. Why, counting 'classified,' we're carrying fifteen hundred ads in
      every issue. With no clue to the character of this one&mdash;&ldquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty of clue,&rdquo; said Average Jones suavely. &ldquo;You'll find it on the
      sporting page, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judging from the man's appearance? Rather far-fetched, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judging from a pair of very fine binoculars, a mention of Carroll
      Morrison's name, and, principally, some two thousand dollars in a huge
      heap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't quite see where that leads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? The bills must have been mostly ones and twos. Those are a
      book-maker's takings. The binocular is a racing-man's glass. Our late
      friend used the language of the track. I think we'll find him on page
      nine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try,&rdquo; said Waldemar, handing him a paper still spicy with the keen odor
      of printer's ink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swiftly the Ad-Visor's practiced eye ran over the column. It checked at
      the &ldquo;offer&rdquo; of a notorious firm of tipsters who advertised to sell &ldquo;inside
      information&rdquo; on the races to their patrons. As a special lure, they were,
      on this day, letting the public in on a few particularly &ldquo;good things&rdquo;
       free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; said Average Jones, pointing out the advertisement.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his astonishment, Waldemar noted that his friend's indicatory finger
      shook a little. Normally, Average Jones was the coolest and most
      controlled of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noble and Gale's form ad,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;I see nothing unusual in that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet&mdash;er&mdash;I fancy it's quite important&mdash;er&mdash;in its
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The editor stared. &ldquo;When you talk like a bored Britisher, Average,&rdquo; he
      remarked, &ldquo;there's sure to be something in the air. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at the last line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Waldemar turned to the paper. &ldquo;'One Best Bet,&rdquo;' he read. &ldquo;'That the
      Pharisee will never finish.' Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That the Pharisee will never finish,&rdquo; repeated Average Jones. &ldquo;If the
      Pharisee is a horse, the line becomes absurd at once. How could any one
      know that a horse would fail to finish in a race? But if it&mdash;er&mdash;referred&mdash;er&mdash;to
      a man, an official known&mdash;er&mdash;as Pharisee Phil&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Waldemar had jumped to his feet. A thrill, increasing and
      pulsating through the floor beneath them, shook the building. The editor
      jumped for the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Composing room; quick! Give me the foreman. Hello! That you, Corrigan?
      Stop the presses... I don't care if we miss every train in the country...
      Don't answer back. This is Mr. Waldemar. Stop the presses!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thrill waned and ceased. At the telephone, Waldemar continued: &ldquo;Look
      up the Noble and Gale tip ad, page nine, column six. Kill the last line,
      the One Best Bet... Don't ask me how. Chisel it out. Burn it out. Dynamite
      it out. But kill it. After that's done, print.... Hello; Dan? Send the
      sporting editor in here in a hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good work,&rdquo; said Average Jones. &ldquo;They'll never know how near their idea
      of removing Governor Arthur came to being boasted of in plain print.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Waldemar took his huge head in his hands and rocked it gently. &ldquo;It's on,&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;And right-side-before. Yet, it tries to tell me that a man,
      plotting to murder the governor, advertises the fact in my paper! I'll get
      a new head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep that one for a while,&rdquo; advised Average Jones. &ldquo;It may be better than
      you think. Anyway, here's the ad. And down yonder is the dead man whom it
      killed when he failed to kill it. So much is real.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here's Bendig,&rdquo; said the other, as the sporting editor entered. &ldquo;Any
      such horse as 'The Pharisee,' Bendig?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. I suppose you mean that Noble and Gale ad. I saw it in proof.
      Some of Nick Karboe's funny work, I expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nick Karboe; N. K.,&rdquo; murmured Average Jones, laying a hand on the
      abandoned field glass. &ldquo;Who is this man Karboe, Mr. Bendig?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Junior partner of Noble and Gale. He puts out their advertising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any connection whatever with Mr. Carroll Morrison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes. Before he went to pieces he used to be Mr. Morrison's
      confidential man, and lately he's been doing some lobbying for the
      association. I understood he'd quit it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit what?&rdquo; asked Waldemar. &ldquo;Drink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse. The white stuff. Coke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones whistled softly. &ldquo;That explains it all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A cocaine
      fiend on a debauch becomes a mental and moral imbecile. It would be
      perfectly in character that he should boast of a projected crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Waldemar, after the sporting editor had left, &ldquo;but you
      don't really connect Morrison with this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't I! At least I propose to try. See here, Waldemar; two months ago at
      a private dinner, Morrison made a speech in which he said that men who
      interfered with the rights of property, like Governor Arthur, were no
      better than anarchists and ought to be handled accordingly. Therefore, I
      don't think that a plan&mdash;a safe one, of course&mdash;to put 'Pharisee
      Phil' away would greatly disturb our friend's distorted conscience. You
      see, the governor has laid impious hands on Morrison's holy of holies, the
      dividend. By the way, where is Governor Arthur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the train for this city. He's to review the parade at the Harrisonia
      Centennial, and unveil the statute to-morrow night; that is, to-night, to
      be accurate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good opportunity,&rdquo; murmured Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! In the sight of a hundred thousand people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That might be the very core of the opportunity. And at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you feel certain, it's a case for the police, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly! The gambling gang control the police, wholly. They would destroy
      the trail at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why not warn the governor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I make an appointment to take you to see him in the morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was agreed upon. At ten o'clock Governor Arthur received them at his
      hotel, greeting Average Jones with flattering warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're the amateur detective who scared the Honorable William Linder out
      of the mayoralty nomination,&rdquo; said he, shaking hands. &ldquo;What are you going
      to do to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give you some racing news to read, Governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The governor took the advertisement proof and read it carefully.
      Characteristically, he then re-read it throughout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think this is meant for me?&rdquo; he asked, handing it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. You're not exactly what one would call popular with the racing
      crowd, you know, Governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Morrison, in the politest manner in the world, has allowed me to
      surmise as much,&rdquo; said the other, smiling broadly. &ldquo;A very polished
      person, Mr. Morrison. He can make threats of extinction&mdash;political,
      of course&mdash;more delicately than any other subtle blackmailer I have
      ever met. And I have met several in my time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this were merely political extinction, which I fancy you can take care
      of yourself, I shouldn't be taking up your time, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Jones&mdash;&rdquo; a friendly hand fell on the visitor's shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;I
      gravely fear that you lack the judicial mind. It's a great thing to lack&mdash;at
      times.&rdquo; Governor Arthur's eyes twinkled again, and his visitor wondered
      whence had come his reputation as a dry, unhumorous man. &ldquo;As to
      assassination,&rdquo; he pursued, &ldquo;I'm a sort of Christian Scientist. The best
      protection is a profound conviction that you're safe. That reacts on the
      mind of any would-be assassin. To my mind, my best chance of safety lies
      in never thinking of danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Waldemar, &ldquo;any attempt to persuade you against appearing at
      Harrisonia to-night would be time wasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely, my dear Waldemar. But don't think that I'm not appreciative
      of your thoughtfulness and that of Mr. Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the program of the day, Governor?&rdquo; asked Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather a theatrical one. I'm to ride along Harrison Avenue to the
      reviewing stand, in the old coach-of-state of the Harrison family, a lofty
      old ark, high as a circus wagon, which has been patched up for the
      occasion. Just before I reach the reviewing stand, a silk cord is to be
      handed to me and I am to pull the veil from the great civic statue with
      that, as, I move on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I think that Mr. Waldemar and I will look the ground over. Could we
      get you by telephone, sir, if necessary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any time up to seven o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of the chance of their passing the bill over your
      veto?&rdquo; asked Waldemar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are spending money as it has never been spent before,&rdquo; replied
      Governor Arthur. &ldquo;I'll admit to you, Waldemar, that if I could find any
      legitimate method of calling Morrison off, I would not scruple to use it.
      It is, of course, Morrison's money that we are fighting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly&mdash;er&mdash;that, too&mdash;er&mdash;might be done,&rdquo; drawled
      Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The governor looked at him sharply. &ldquo;After the Linder affair, Mr. Jones,&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;I would follow you far. Call my secretary at any time, if you
      want me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now to look over the line of parade,&rdquo; said Average Jones as he and
      Waldemar emerged from the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour's ride brought them to the lively suburban city of
      Harrisonia, gay with flags and bunting. From the railroad station, where
      the guest of honor was to be met by the old coach, to the spot where the
      civic statue awaited its unveiling at his hands, was about half a mile
      along Harrison Avenue, the principal street. The walk along this street
      developed nothing of interest to Average Jones until they reached the
      statue. Here he paused to look curiously at a number of square platforms
      built out from windows in the business blocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For flash-light outfits,&rdquo; explained Waldemar. &ldquo;One of them is our
      paper's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flash-lights, eh?&rdquo; said Average Jones. &ldquo;And there'll be fireworks and the
      air will be full of light and noise, under cover of which almost anything
      might be done. I don't like it! Hello! What's here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the glass front of a prosperous-looking cigar store on the
      south side of the avenue and pointed to a shattered hole in the window.
      Behind it a bullet swung on a thread from the ceiling, and this agent of
      disaster the proprietor had ingeniously turned to account in advertising,
      by the following placard:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                       AIM LOWER
       If you expect to shoot holes in our prices.
               WE CHALLENGE OUR COMPETITION
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; approved Average Jones. &ldquo;I feel a great yearning to smoke&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They entered the store and were served by the proprietor. As he was making
      change, Average Jones asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When was the bombardment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Night before last, some time,&rdquo; replied the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done by a deflected bullet, wasn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't any idea how it was done or why. I got here in the morning and
      there she was. What makes you think it was a deflected bullet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it was whirling end-over. Normally, a bullet bores a pretty clean
      hole in plate glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so, too,&rdquo; agreed the man with some interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones handed a cigar to Waldemar and lighted one himself. Puffing
      at it as he walked to the door, he gazed casually around and finally
      centered his attention on a telegraph pole standing on the edge of the
      sidewalk. He even walked out and around the pole. Returning, he remarked
      to the tobacconist:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good cigars, these. Ever advertise 'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; The man displayed a tin square vaunting the virtues of his
      &ldquo;Camarados.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Outside the shop, I meant. Why wouldn't one of those signs look good on
      that telegraph pole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would look good to me,&rdquo; said the vendor, &ldquo;but it wouldn't look good to
      the telegraph people. They'd have it down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't know. Give me one, lend me a ladder, and I'll make the
      experiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tobacconist stared. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go as far as you like.&rdquo; And
      he got the required articles for his customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      With silent curiosity Waldemar watched Average Jones place the ladder
      against the outside of the pole, mount, nail up the sign, drop a
      plumb-line, improvised from a key and a length of string, to the ground,
      set a careful knot in the string and return to earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you find?&rdquo; asked the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four holes that you could cover with a silver dollar. Some gunnery,
      that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how did the other shot happen to go so far wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see that steel work over there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones pointed across to the north side of the street, just
      opposite, where a number of buildings had been torn down to permit of the
      erection of a new one. The frame had risen three stories, and through the
      open spaces in the gaunt skeleton the rear of the houses facing on the
      street next northward could be seen. Waldemar indicated that he did see
      the edifice pointed out by Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bullet came from back of that&mdash;perhaps from the next street.
      They sighted by the telegraph pole. Suppose, now, a man riding in a high
      coach passes along this avenue between the pole and the gun operator, over
      yonder to the northward. Every one of the bullets which hit the pole would
      have gone right through his body. Probably a fixed gun. As for the wide
      shot, we'll see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the Ad-Visor was leading the way across the street. With
      upturned face he carefully studied the steel joists from end to end.
      Presently he pointed. Following the line of his finger, Waldemar saw a raw
      scar on the under side of one of the joists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; said Average Jones. &ldquo;The sights were a trifle off at the
      first shot, and the bullet ticked the steel and deflected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far, so good,&rdquo; approved Waldemar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can approximate the height of the steel beam from the ground, close
      enough for a trial formula,&rdquo; continued Average Jones. &ldquo;Now, Waldemar, I
      call your attention to that restaurant on the opposite corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Waldemar conned the designated building with attention. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said
      finally, &ldquo;what of it? I don't see anything wrong with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely my point,&rdquo; returned the Ad-Visor with a grin. &ldquo;Neither do I.
      Therefore, suppose you go there and order luncheon for two, while I walk
      down to the next block and back again. I'll be with you in four minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was somewhat better than his word. Dropping into the chair opposite his
      friend, he figured swiftly and briefly on the back of an envelope, which
      he returned to his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you've done a vast amount of investigating since you left me,&rdquo;
       remarked the editor sardonically. &ldquo;Meanwhile, the plot to murder the
      governor goes merrily on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've done a fair amount of pacing over distance,&rdquo; retorted Average Jones
      imperturbably. &ldquo;As for the governor, they can't kill him till he comes,
      can they? Besides, there's plenty of time for them to change their minds.
      As a result of my little constitutional just now, and a simple exercise in
      mathematics, you and I will call at a house on Spencer Street, the next
      street north, after luncheon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that I don't know, as yet. We'll see when we get there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Comfortably fed, the two strolled up to Spencer Street and turned into it,
      Average Jones eying the upper windows of the houses. He stopped in front
      of an old-fashioned frame structure, which was built on a different plan
      of floor level from its smaller neighbors of brick. Up the low steps went
      Jones, followed by the editor. An aged lady, of the species commonly,
      conjectured as &ldquo;maiden,&rdquo; opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Average Jones, &ldquo;could we rent your third floor rear for this
      evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It's rented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I could buy the renters off,&rdquo; suggested Jones. &ldquo;Could I see
      them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both out,&rdquo; she answered shortly. &ldquo;And I don't believe you could get the
      room from them, for they're all fixed up to take photographs of the
      parade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indee-ee-eed,&rdquo; drawled Average Jones, in accents so prolonged, even for
      him, that Waldemar's interest flamed within him. &ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;ra&mdash;ra-aather
      hoped&mdash;er&mdash;when do you expect them back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About four o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Please tell them that&mdash;er&mdash;Mr. Nick Karboe called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven's sake, Average,&rdquo; rumbled Waldemar, as they regained the
      pavement, &ldquo;why did you use the dead man's name? It gave me a shiver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It'll give them a worse one,&rdquo; replied the Ad-Visor grimly. &ldquo;I want to
      prepare their nerves for a subsequent shock. If you'll meet me here this
      evening at seven, I think I can promise you a queer spectacle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And meantime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On that point I want your advice. Shall we make a sure catch of two hired
      assassins who don't amount to much, or take a chance at the bigger game?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning Morrison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning Morrison. Incidentally, if we get him we'll be able to kill the
      Personal Liberty bill so dead it will never raise its head again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'm for that course,&rdquo; decided the editor, after a little
      consideration, &ldquo;though I can't yet make myself believe that Carroll
      Morrison is party to a deliberate murder plot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How the normal mind does shrink from connecting crime with good clothes
      and a social position!&rdquo; remarked the Ad-Visor. &ldquo;Just give me a moment's
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment he spent jotting down words on a bit of paper, which, after
      some emendation, he put away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'll do for a heading,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Now, Waldemar, I want you to get
      the governor on the 'phone and tell him, if he'll follow directions, we'll
      put the personal liberty bill where the wicked cease from troubling.
      Morrison is to be in the reviewing stand, isn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; there's a special place reserved for him, next the press seats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! By the way, you'd better send for two press seats for you and
      myself. Now, what I want: the governor to do is this: get a copy of the
      Harrisonia Evening Bell, fold it to an advertisement headed 'Offer to
      Photographers,' and as he passes Carroll Morrison on the stand, hold it up
      and say to him just this: 'Better luck next time.' For anything further,
      I'll see you in the reviewing stand. Do you think he'll do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds as foolish as a college initiation stunt. Still, you heard what
      Governor Arthur said about his confidence in you. But what is this
      advertisement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As yet, it isn't. But it will be, as soon as I can get to the office of
      the Bell. You'll meet me on this corner at seven o'clock, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Meantime, to be safe, I'll look after the reviewing stand tickets
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the hour named, the editor arrived. Average Jones was already there,
      accompanied by a messenger boy. The boy wore the cheerful grin of one who
      has met with an unexpected favor of fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've returned, both of 'em,&rdquo; said Average Jones as Waldemar
      approached. &ldquo;What about the governor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It took a mighty lot of persuasion, but he'll do it,&rdquo; replied the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skip, son,&rdquo; said the Ad-Visor, handing the messenger boy a folded
      newspaper. &ldquo;The two gentlemen on the third floor rear. And be sure you say
      that it's a personal, marked copy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy crossed the street and entered the house. In two minutes he
      emerged, nodded to Average Jones and walked away. Five minutes passed.
      Then the front door opened cautiously and a tall, evil-looking man slunk
      into the vestibule. A second man followed him. They glanced eagerly from
      left to right. Average Jones stepped out to the curb-stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's the message from Karboe,&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; gasped the tall man.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant he made as if to turn back. Then, clearing the steps at one
      jump, he stumbled, sprawled, was up again instantly and speeding up the
      street, away from Average Jones, turned the corner neck and neck with his
      companion who, running powerfully, had overtaken him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the house stood ajar. Before Waldemar had recovered from his
      surprise, Average Jones was inside the house. Hesitation beset the editor.
      Should he follow or wait? He paused, one foot on the step. A loud crash
      within resolved his doubts. Up he started, when the voice of Average Jones
      in colloquy with the woman who had received them before, checked him. The
      colloquy seemed excited but peaceful. Presently Average Jones came down
      the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They left the ad,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Have you seen it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I hadn't time to get a paper,&rdquo; replied Waldemar, taking the copy
      extended to him and reading in large display:

</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder they ran,&rdquo; said Waldemar with a grin, as he digested this
      document.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so must we if we're to get through the crowd and reach the reviewing
      stand,&rdquo; warned Average Jones, glancing at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their seats, which they attained with some difficulty, were within a few
      feet of the governor's box. Within reach of them sat Carroll Morrison, his
      long, pale, black-bearded face set in that immobility to which he had
      schooled it. But the cold eyes roved restlessly and the little muscles at
      the corners of the lips twitched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me that he isn't in on the game!&rdquo; whispered Average Jones, and
      Waldemar nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of music from down the street turned all faces in that
      direction. A roar of cheering swept toward them and was taken up in the
      stands. The governor, in his high coach, came in sight. And, at that
      moment, terror struck into the soul of Waldemar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose they came back!&rdquo; he whispered to Average Jones. &ldquo;We've left the
      house unguarded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've fixed that,&rdquo; replied the Ad-Visor in the same tone. &ldquo;Watch
      Morrison!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Governor Arthur approached the civic statue. An official, running out to
      the coach, handed him a silken cord, which he secured with a turn around
      the wrist. The coach rolled on. The cord tautened; the swathings sundered
      and fell from the gleaming splendor of marble, and a blinding flash,
      followed by another, and a third, blotted out the scene in unbearable
      radiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily Morrison, like thousands of others, had screened his sight
      with his hands after the second flash. Now, as the kindlier light
      returned, he half rose, rubbing his eyes furiously. A half-groan escaped
      him. He sank back, staring in amaze. For Governor Arthur was riding on,
      calm and smiling amid the shouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morrison shrank. Could it be that the governor's eyes were fixed on his?
      He strove to shake off the delusion. He felt, rather than saw, the guest
      of honor descend from the coach; felt rather than saw him making straight
      toward himself; and he winced and quivered at the sound of his own name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Morrison,&rdquo; the governor was saying, at his elbow, &ldquo;Mr. Morrison, here
      is a paper that may interest you. Better luck next time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morrison strove to reply. His voice clucked in his throat, and the hand
      with which he took the folded newspaper was as the hand of a paralytic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's broken,&rdquo; whispered Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went straight to Governor Arthur, speaking in his ear. The governor
      nodded. Average Jones returned to his seat to watch Carroll Morrison who,
      sat, with hell-fires of fear scorching him, until the last band had blared
      its way into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the governor was speaking to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Mr. Morrison, I want you to visit a house near here. Mr. Jones and Mr.
      Waldemar will come along; you know them, perhaps. Please don't protest. I
      positively will not take a refusal. We have a motor-car waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furious, but not daring to refuse, Morrison found himself whirled swiftly
      away, and after a few turns to shake off the crowd, into Spencer Street.
      With his captors, he mounted to the third floor of an old frame house. The
      rear room door had been broken in. Inside stood a strange instrument,
      resembling a large camera, which had once stood upright on a steel tripod
      riveted to the floor. The legs of the tripod were twisted and bent. A
      half-demolished chair near by suggested the agency of destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just to render it harmless,&rdquo; explained Average Jones. &ldquo;It formerly
      pointed through that window, so that a bullet from the barrel would strike
      that pole way yonder in Harrison Street, after first passing through any
      intervening body. Yours, for instance, Governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I understand that this is a gun, Mr. Jones,&rdquo; asked that official.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of a sort,&rdquo; replied the Ad-Visor, opening up the camera-box and showing a
      large barrel superimposed on a smaller one. &ldquo;This is a sighting-glass,&rdquo; he
      explained, tapping the larger barrel. &ldquo;And this,&rdquo; tapping the smaller,
      &ldquo;carries a small but efficient bullet. This curious sheath&rdquo;&mdash;he
      pointed to a cylindrical jacket around part of the rifle barrel&mdash;&ldquo;is
      a Coulomb silencer, which reduces a small-arm report almost to a whisper.
      Here is an electric button which was connected with yonder battery before
      I operated on it with the chair, and distributed its spark, part to the
      gun, part to the flash-light powder on this little shelf. Do you see the
      plan now? The instant that the governor, riding through the street yonder,
      is sighted through this glass, the operator presses the button, and
      flash-light and bullet go off instantaneously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why the flash-light?&rdquo; asked the governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merely a blind to fool the landlady and avert any possible suspicion.
      They had told her that they had a new invention to take flash-lights at a
      distance. Amidst the other flashes, this one wouldn't be noticed
      particularly. They had covered their trail well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, indeed,&rdquo; said the governor. &ldquo;May I congratulate you, Mr. Morrison,
      on this interesting achievement in ballistics?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As there is no way of properly resenting an insult from a man in your
      position,&rdquo; said Morrison venomously, &ldquo;I will reserve my answer to that
      outrageous suggestion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meantime,&rdquo; put in Average Jones, &ldquo;let me direct your attention to a
      simple mathematical formula.&rdquo; He drew from his pocket an envelope on which
      were drawn some angles, subjoined by a formula. Morrison waved it aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not interested in mathematics?&rdquo; asked Average Jones solicitously. &ldquo;Very
      well, I'll elucidate informally. Given a bullet hole in a telegraph pole
      at a certain distance, a bullet scar on an iron girder at a certain lesser
      distance, and the length of a block from here to Harrison Avenue&mdash;which
      I paced off while you were skillfully ordering luncheon, Waldemar&mdash;and
      an easy triangulation brings us direct to this room and to two fugitive
      gentlemen with whom I mention the hypothesis with all deference, Mr.
      Morrison, you are probably acquainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who may they have been?&rdquo; retorted Morrison contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, sir,&rdquo; retorted the racing king, &ldquo;your hypothesis is as impudent as
      your company is intolerable. Have you anything further to say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It would greatly please Mr. Waldemar to publish in to-morrow's paper
      an authorized statement from you to the effect that the Personal Liberty
      bill will be withdrawn permanently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Waldemar may go to the devil. I have endured all the hectoring I
      propose to. Men in my position are targets for muckrakers and blackmailers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; Waldemar's heavy voice broke in. &ldquo;You speak of men in
      your position. Do you understand just what position you are in at
      present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morrison rose. &ldquo;Governor Arthur,&rdquo; he said with with stony dignity, &ldquo;I bid
      you good evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Waldemar set his bulky back against the door. The lips drew back from
      Morrison's strong teeth with the snarl of an animal in the fury and terror
      of approaching peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know Nick Karboe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morrison whirled about to face Average Jones. But he did not answer the
      question. He only stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carroll Morrison,&rdquo; continued Average Jones in his quiet drawl, &ldquo;the
      half-hour before he&mdash;er&mdash;committed suicide&mdash;er&mdash;Nick
      Karboe spent in the office of the&mdash;er&mdash;Universal with Mr.
      Waldemar and&mdash;er&mdash;myself. Catch him, Waldemar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For Morrison had wilted. They propped him against the wall and he, the man
      who had insolently defied the laws of a great commonwealth, who had bribed
      legislatures and bossed judges and browbeaten the public, slobbered,
      denied and begged. For two disgustful minutes they extracted from him his
      solemn promise that henceforth he would keep his hands off the laws. Then
      they turned him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you enlighten me with the story, gentlemen,&rdquo; suggested the
      governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones told it, simply and modestly. At the conclusion, Governor
      Arthur looked from the wrecked camera-gun to the mathematical formula
      which had fallen to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Jones,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you've done me the service of saving my life;
      you've done the public the service of killing a vicious bill. I wish I
      could thank you more publicly than this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Governor,&rdquo; said Average' Jones modestly. &ldquo;But I owed the
      public something, you know, on account of, my uncle, the late Mayor Van
      Reypen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Governor Arthur nodded. &ldquo;The debt is paid,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That knowledge must
      be your reward; that and the consciousness of having worked out a
      remarkable and original problem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Original?&rdquo; said Average Jones, eying the diagram on the envelope's back,
      with his quaint smile. &ldquo;Why, Governor, you're giving me too much credit.
      It was worked out by one of the greatest detectives of all time, some two
      thousand years ago. His name was Euclid.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XI. THE MILLION-DOLLAR DOG
    </h2>
    <p>
      To this day, Average Jones maintains that he felt a distinct thrill at
      first sight of the advertisement. Yet Fate might well have chosen a more
      appropriate ambush in any one of a hundred of the strange clippings which
      were grist to the Ad-Visor's mill. Out of a bulky pile of the day's
      paragraphs, however, it was this one that leaped, significant, to his eye.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     WANTED&mdash;Ten thousand loathly black beetles, by
     A leaseholder who contracted to leave a house in the
     same condition as he found it. Ackroyd,
     100 W. Sixteenth St. New York
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Black beetles, eh?&rdquo; observed Average Jones. &ldquo;This Ackroyd person seems to
      be a merry little jester. Well, I'm feeling rather jocular, myself, this
      morning. How does one collect black beetles, I wonder? When in doubt,
      inquire of the resourceful Simpson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pressed a button and his confidential clerk entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Simpson,&rdquo; said Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you acquainted with that shy but pervasive animal, the domestic black
      beetle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I board,&rdquo; said Simpson simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose there aren't ten thousand black beetles in your boarding-house,
      though?&rdquo; inquired Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simpson took it under advisement. &ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; he decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got to have 'em to fill an order. At least, I've got to have an
      installment of 'em, and to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Being wholly without imagination, the confidential clerk was impervious to
      surprise or shock. This was fortunate, for otherwise, his employment as
      practical aide to Average Jones would probably have driven him into a
      madhouse. He now ran his long, thin, clerkly hands through his long, thin,
      clerkly hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ramson, down on Fulton Street, will have them, if any one has,&rdquo; he said
      presently. &ldquo;He does business under the title of the Insect Nemesis, you
      know. I'll go there at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Returning to his routine work, Average Jones found himself unable to
      dislodge the advertisement from his mind. So presently he gave way to
      temptation, called up Bertram at the Cosmic Club, and asked him to come to
      the Astor Court Temple office at his convenience. Scenting more adventure,
      Bertram found it convenient to come promptly. Average Jones handed him the
      clipping. Bertram read it with ascending eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoots!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The man's mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't ask you here to diagnose the advertiser's trouble. That's plain
      enough&mdash;though you've made a bad guess. What I want of you is to tap
      your flow of information about old New York. What's at One Hundred West
      Sixteenth Street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hundred West Sixteenth; let me see. Why, of course; it's the old
      Feltner mansion. You must know it. It has a walled garden at the side; the
      only one left in the city, south of Central Park.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one named Ackroyd there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be Hawley Ackroyd. I remember, now, hearing that he had rented
      it. Judge Ackroyd, you know, better known as 'Oily' Ackroyd. He's a smooth
      old rascal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? What particular sort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, most sorts, in private. Professionally, he's a legislative crook;
      head lobbyist of the Consolidated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever hear of his collecting insects?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard of his collecting anything but graft. In fact, he'd have been
      in jail years ago, but for his family connections. He married a Van
      Haltern. You remember the famous Van Haltern will case, surely; the
      million-dollar dog. The papers fairly, reeked of it a year ago. Sylvia
      Graham had to take the dog and leave the country to escape the notoriety.
      She's back now, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard of Miss Graham,&rdquo; remarked Average Jones, &ldquo;through friends of
      mine whom she visits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you've only heard of her and not seen her,&rdquo; returned Bertram,
      with something as nearly resembling enthusiasm as his habitual languor
      permitted, &ldquo;you've got something to look forward to. Sylvia Graham is a
      distinct asset to the Scheme of Creation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An asset with assets of her own, I believe,&rdquo; said Average Jones. &ldquo;The
      million dollars left by her grandmother, old Mrs. Van Haltern, goes to her
      eventually; doesn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provided she carries out the terms of the will, keeps the dog in proper
      luxury and buries him in the grave on the family estate at Schuylkill
      designated by the testator. If these terms are not rigidly carried out,
      the fortune is to be divided, most of it going to Mrs. Hawley Ackroyd,
      which would mean the judge himself. I should say that the dog was as good
      as sausage meat if 'Oily' ever gets hold of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm. What about Mrs. Ackroyd?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor, sickly, frightened lady! She's very fond of Sylvia Graham, who is
      her niece. But she's completely dominated by her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Information is your long suit, Bert. Now, if you only had intelligence to
      correspond&mdash;&rdquo; Average Jones broke off and grinned mildly, first at
      his friend, then at the advertisement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram caught up the paper and studied it. &ldquo;Well, what does it mean?&rdquo; he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means that Ackroyd, being about to give up his rented house, intends
      to saddle it with a bad name. Probably he's had a row with the agent or
      owner, and is getting even by making the place difficult to rent again.
      Nobody wants to take a house with the reputation of an entomological
      resort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be just like Oily Ackroyd,&rdquo; remarked Bertram. &ldquo;He's a vindictive
      scoundrel. Only a few days ago, he nearly killed a poor devil of a drug
      clerk, over some trifling dispute. He managed to keep it out of the
      newspapers but he had to pay a stiff fine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That might be worth looking up, too,&rdquo; ruminated Average Jones
      thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to his telephone in answer to a ring. &ldquo;All right, come, in,
      Simpson,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The confidential clerk appeared. &ldquo;Ramson says that regular black beetles
      are out of season, sir,&rdquo; he reported. &ldquo;But he can send to the country and
      dig up plenty of red-and-black ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; returned the Ad-Visor. &ldquo;Tell him to have two or three
      hundred here to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram bent a severe gaze on his friend. &ldquo;Meaning that you're going to
      follow up this freak affair?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just that. I can't explain why, but&mdash;well, Bert, I've a hunch. At
      the worst, Ackroyd's face when he sees the beetles should be worth the
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you frivol, Average, I wash my hands of you. But I warn you, look
      out for Ackroyd. He's as big as he is ugly; a tough customer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I'll just put on some old clothes, to dress the part of a
      beetle-purveyor correctly, and also in case I get 'em torn in my meeting
      with judge 'Oily.' I'll see you later&mdash;and report, if I survive his
      wrath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that, on the morning after this dialogue, a clean-built young
      fellow walked along West Sixteenth Street, appreciatively sniffing the
      sunny crispness of the May air. He was rather shabby looking, yet his
      demeanor was by no means shabby. It was confident and easy. On the
      evidence of the bandbox which he carried, his mission should have been
      menial; but he bore himself wholly unlike one subdued to petty
      employments. His steady, gray eyes showed a glint of anticipation as he
      turned in at the gate of the high, broad, brown house standing back, aloof
      and indignant, from the roaring encroachments of trade. He set his burden
      down and, pulled the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened promptly to the deep, far-away clangor. A flashing
      impression of girlish freshness, vigor, and grace was disclosed to the
      caller against a background of interior gloom. He stared a little more
      patently than was polite. Whatever his expectation of amusement, this,
      evidently, was not the manifestation looked for. The girl glanced not at
      him, but at the box, and spoke a trifle impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it's my hat, it's very late. You should have gone to the basement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't, miss,&rdquo; said the young man, in a form of address, the
      semi-servility of which seemed distinctly out of tone with the quietly
      clear and assured voice. &ldquo;It's the insects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The what?&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bugs, miss.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      He extracted from his pocket a slip of paper, looked from it to the
      numbered door, as one verifying an address, and handed it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From yesterday's copy of the Banner, miss. You're not going back on that,
      surely,&rdquo; he said somewhat reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      She read, and as she read her eyes widened to lakes of limpid brown. Then
      they crinkled at the corners, and her laugh rose from the mid-tone
      contralto, to a high, bird-like trill of joyousness. The infection of it
      tugged at the young man's throat, but he successfully preserved his mask
      of flat and respectful dullness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been Uncle,&rdquo; she gasped finally. &ldquo;He said he'd be quits with
      the real estate agent before he left. How perfectly absurd! And are those
      the creatures in that box?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first couple of hundred of 'em, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred!&rdquo; Again the access of laughter swelled the rounded bosom as
      the breeze fills a sail. &ldquo;Where did you get them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woodpile, ash-heap, garbage-pail,&rdquo; said the young man stolidly. &ldquo;Any
      particular kind preferred, Miss Ackroyd?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked at him with suspicion, but his face was blankly innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not Miss Ackroyd,&rdquo; she began with emphasis, when a querulous voice
      from an inner room called out: &ldquo;Whom are you talking to, Sylvia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young man with a boxful of beetles,&rdquo; returned the girl, adding in brisk
      French: &ldquo;Il est tres amusant ce farceur. Je ne le comprends pas du tout.
      Cest une blague, peut-etre. Si on l'invitait dans la maison pour un
      moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through one of the air-holes, considerately punched in the cardboard cover
      of the box, a sturdy crawler had succeeded in pushing himself. He was, in
      the main, of a shiny and well-groomed black, but two large patches of
      crimson gave him the festive appearance of being garbed in a brilliant
      sash. As he stood rubbing his fore-legs together in self-congratulation
      over his exploit, his bearer addressed him in French quite as ready as the
      girl's:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permettez-moi, Monsieur le Colioptere, de vous presenter mes excuses pour
      cette demoiselle qui s'exprime en langue etrangere chez elle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't apologize to the beetle on my account,&rdquo; retorted the girl with
      spirit. &ldquo;You're here on your own terms, you know, both of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones mutely held up the box in one hand and the advertisement in
      the other. The adventurer-bug flourished a farewell to the girl with his
      antennae, and retired within to advise his fellows of the charms of
      freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the girl, in demure tones, though lambent mirth still
      flickered, golden, in the depths of the brown eyes. &ldquo;If you persist, I can
      only suggest that you come back when Judge Ackroyd is here. You won't find
      him particularly amenable to humor, particularly when perpetrated by a
      practical joker in masquerade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Discovered,&rdquo; murmured Average Jones. &ldquo;I shouldn't have vaunted my poor
      French. But must I really take my little friends all the way back? You
      suggested to the mystic voice within that I might be invited inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem a decidedly unconventional person,&rdquo; began the other with dawning
      disfavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conventionality, like charity, begins at home,&rdquo; he replied quickly. &ldquo;And
      one would hardly call this advertisement a pattern of formal etiquette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True enough,&rdquo; she admitted, dimpling, and Average Jones was
      congratulating himself on his diplomacy, when the querulous voice broke in
      again, this time too low for his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't ask you the real reason for your extraordinary call,&rdquo; pursued the
      girl with a glint of mischief in her eyes, after she had responded in an
      aside, &ldquo;but auntie thinks you've come to steal my dog. She thinks that of
      every one lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie? Your dog? Then you're Sylvia Graham. I might have known it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how you might have known it. But I am Sylvia Graham&mdash;if
      you insist on introducing me to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Graham,&rdquo; said the visitor promptly and gravely, &ldquo;let me present
      A.V.R.E. Jones: a friend&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the famous Average Jones!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;That is why your face
      seemed so familiar. I've seen your picture at Edna Hale's. You got her
      'blue fires' back for her. But really, that hardly explains your being
      here, in this way, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frankly, Miss Graham, it was just as a lark that I answered the
      advertisement. But now that I'm here and find you here, it looks&mdash;er&mdash;as
      if it might&mdash;er&mdash;be more serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tinge of pink came into the girl's cheeks, but she answered lightly
      enough:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, it may, for you, if uncle finds you here with those beetles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind me or the beetles. I'd like to know about the dog that your
      aunt is worrying over. Is he here with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soft curve of Miss Graham's lips straightened a little. &ldquo;I really
      think,&rdquo; she said with decision, &ldquo;that you had better explain further
      before questioning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing simpler. Once upon a time there lived a crack-brained young Don
      Quixote who wandered through an age of buried romance piously searching
      for trouble. And, twice upon a time, there dwelt in an enchanted stone
      castle in West Sixteenth Street an enchanting young damsel in distress&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not a damsel in distress,&rdquo; interrupted Miss Graham, passing over the
      adjective.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man leaned to her. The half smile had passed from his lips, and
      his eyes were very grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not&mdash;er&mdash;if your dog were to&mdash;er&mdash;disappear?&rdquo; he
      drawled quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The swift unexpectedness of the counter broke down the girl's guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Uncle Hawley,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your suspicions jump with mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don't!&rdquo; she denied hotly. &ldquo;You're very unjust and impertinent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean to be impertinent,&rdquo; he said evenly. &ldquo;And I have no monopoly
      of injustice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know about Uncle Hawley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your aunt&mdash;&ldquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't hear a word against my aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not from me, be assured. Your aunt, so you have just told me, believes
      that your dog is in danger of being stolen. Why? Because she knows that
      the person most interested has been scheming against the animal, and yet
      she is afraid to warn you openly. Doesn't that indicate who it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Jones, I've no right even to let you talk like this to me. Have you
      anything definite against Judge Ackroyd?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this case, only suspicion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her head went up. &ldquo;Then I think there is nothing more to be said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man flushed, but his voice was steady as he returned:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I disagree with you. And I beg you to cut short your visit here, and
      return to your home at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of herself the girl was shaken by his persistence. &ldquo;I can't do
      that,&rdquo; she said uneasily. And added, with a flash of anger, &ldquo;I think you
      had better leave this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I leave this house now I may never have any chance to see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl regarded him with level, non-committal eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have every intention of seeing you again&mdash;and&mdash;again&mdash;and
      again. Give me a chance; a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones' mind was of the emergency type. It summoned to its aid,
      without effort of cerebration on the part of its owner, whatever was most
      needed at the moment. Now it came to his rescue with the memory of judge
      Ackroyd's encounter with the drug clerk, as mentioned by Bertram. There
      was a strangely hopeful suggestion of some link between a drug-store
      quarrel and the arrival of a million-dollar dog, &ldquo;better dead&rdquo; in the
      hopes of his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Graham; I've gone rather far, I'll admit,&rdquo; said Jones; &ldquo;but, if
      you'll give me the benefit of the doubt, I think I can show you some basis
      to work on. If I can produce something tangible, may I come back here this
      afternoon? I'll promise not to come unless I have good reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; conceded Miss Graham reluctantly, &ldquo;it's a most unusual thing.
      But I'll agree to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Au revoir, then,&rdquo; he said, and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat to her surprise and uneasiness, Sylvia Graham experienced a
      distinct satisfaction when, late that afternoon, she beheld her
      unconventional acquaintance mounting the steps with a buoyant and assured
      step. Upon being admitted, he went promptly to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your justification for coming back?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. Have you heard anything of some trouble in which judge Ackroyd
      was involved last week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle has a very violent temper,&rdquo; admitted the girl evasively. &ldquo;But I
      don't see what&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me. You will see. That row was with a drug clerk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an obscure drug store several blocks from here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The drug clerk insisted&mdash;as the law requires&mdash;on judge Ackroyd
      registering for a certain purchase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he was impertinent about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly. The point is that the prospective purchase was cyanide of
      potassium, a deadly and instantaneous poison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; asked the girl, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've just come from the store. How long have you been here at your
      uncle's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then just about the time of your coming with the dog, your uncle
      undertook to obtain a swift and sure poison. Have I gone far enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, am I still ordered out of the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-n-no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for your enthusiastic hospitality,&rdquo; said Average Jones so dryly
      that a smile relaxed the girl's troubled face. &ldquo;With that encouragement
      we'll go on. What is your uncle's attitude toward the dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost what you might call ingratiating. But Peter Paul&mdash;that's my
      dog's name, you know&mdash;doesn't take to uncle. He's a crotchety old
      doggie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a wise old doggie,&rdquo; amended the other, with emphasis. &ldquo;Has your
      uncle taken him out, at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once he tried to. I met them at the corner. All four of Peter Paul's poor
      old fat legs were braced, and he was hauling back as hard as he could
      against the leash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the occurrence didn't strike you as peculiar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When does your uncle give up this house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the end of the week. Uncle and aunt leave for Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me suggest again that you and Peter Paul go at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Graham pondered. &ldquo;That would mean explanations and a quarrel, and
      more strain for auntie, who is nervous enough, anyway. No, I can't do
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you realize that every day Peter Paul remains here is an added
      opportunity for judge Ackroyd to make a million dollars, or a big share of
      it, by some very simple stratagem?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't admitted yet that I believe my uncle to be a&mdash;a murderer,&rdquo;
       Miss Graham quietly reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A strong word,&rdquo; said Average Jones smiling. &ldquo;The law would hardly support
      your view. Now, Miss Graham, would it grieve you very much if Peter Paul
      were to die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't have him put to death,&rdquo; said she quickly. &ldquo;That would be,
      cheating my grandmother's intentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I supposed you wouldn't. Yet it would be the simplest way. Once dead, and
      buried in accordance with the terms of the will, the dog would be out of
      his troubles, and you would be out of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would really be a relief. Peter Paul suffers so from asthma, poor old
      beastie. The vet says he can live only a month or two longer, anyway. But
      I've got to do as Grandmother wished, and keep Peter Paul alive as long as
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admitted.&rdquo; Average Jones fell into a baffled silence, studying the
      pattern of the rug with restless eyes. When he looked up into Miss
      Graham's face again it was with a changed expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Graham,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;won't you try to forget, for the moment,
      the circumstances of our meeting, and think of me only as a friend of your
      friends who is very honestly eager to be a friend to you, when you most
      need one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, Average Jones's birth-fairy had endowed him with one priceless gift:
      the power of inspiring an instinctive confidence in himself. Sylvia Graham
      felt, suddenly, that a hand, sure and firm, had been outstretched to guide
      her on a dark path. In one of those rare flashes of companionship which
      come only when clean and honorable spirits recognize one another, all
      consciousness of sex was lost between them. The girl's gaze met the man's
      level, and was held in a long, silent regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said simply; and the heart of Average Jones rose and swore a
      high loyalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, then. I think I see a clear way. Judge Ackroyd will kill the dog
      if he can, and so effectually conceal the body that no funeral can be held
      over it, thereby rendering your grandmother's bequest to you void. He has
      only a few days to do it in, but I don't think that all your watchfulness
      can restrain him. Now, on the other hand, if the dog should die a natural
      death and be buried, he can still contest the will. But if he should kill
      Peter Paul and hide the body where we could discover it, the game would be
      up for him, as he then wouldn't even dare to come into court with a
      contest. Do you follow me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But you wouldn't ask me to be a party to any such thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a party, involuntarily, by remaining here. But do your best to
      save Peter Paul, if you will. And please call me up immediately at the
      Cosmic Club, if anything in my line turns up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your line?&rdquo; asked Miss Graham, the smile returning to her lips.
      &ldquo;Creepy, crawly bugs? Or imperiled dogs? Or rescuing prospectively
      distressed damsels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Technically it's advertising,&rdquo; replied Average Jones, who had been
      formulating a shrewd little plan of his own. &ldquo;Let me recommend to you the
      advertising columns of the daily press. They're often amusing. Moreover
      your uncle might break out in print again. Who knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, indeed? I'll read religiously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, by the way, my beetles. I forgot and left them here. Oh, there's the
      box. I may have a very specific use for them later. Au revoir&mdash;and
      may it be soon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two days succeeding seemed to Average Jones, haunted as he was by an
      importunate craving to look again into Miss Graham's limpid and changeful
      eyes, a dull and sodden period of probation. The messenger boy who finally
      brought her expected note, looked to him like a Greek godling. The note
      enclosed this clipping:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     LOST-Pug dog answering to the name of Peter Paul.
     Very old and asthmatic. Last seen on West 16th Street.
     Liberal reward for information to Anxious. Care of Banner
     office.
</pre>
    <p>
      Dear Mr. Jones (she had written):
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you a prophet? (Average Jones chuckled, at this point.) The enclosed
      seems to be distinctly in our line. Could you come some time this
      afternoon? I'm puzzled and a little anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sincerely yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia Graham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones could, and did. He found Miss Graham's piquant face under
      the stress of excitement, distinctly more alluring than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it strange?&rdquo; she said, holding out a hand in welcome. &ldquo;Why should
      any one advertise for my Peter Paul? He isn't lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear that,&rdquo; said the caller gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've kept my promise, you see,&rdquo; pursued the girl. &ldquo;Can you do as well,
      and live up to your profession of aid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, do you know what that advertisement means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you're a very extraordinary person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least. I wrote it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrote it! You? Well&mdash;really! Why in the world did you write it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because of an unconquerable longing to see,&rdquo; Average Jones paused, and
      his quick glance caught the storm signal in her eyes, &ldquo;your uncle,&rdquo; he
      concluded calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one fleeting instant a dimple flickered at the corner of her mouth. It
      departed. But departing, it swept the storm before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to see uncle about, if it isn't an impertinent
      question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, rather,&rdquo; returned the young man judicially. &ldquo;Particularly, as I'm
      not sure, myself. I may want to quarrel with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't have the slightest difficulty in that,&rdquo; the girl assured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rang the bell, dispatched a servant, and presently judge Ackroyd
      stalked into the room. As Average Jones was being presented, he took
      comprehensive note and estimate of the broad-cheeked, thin-lipped face;
      the square shoulders and corded neck, and the lithe and formidable
      carriage of the man. Judge &ldquo;Oily&rdquo; Ackroyd's greeting of the guest within
      his gates did not bear out the sobriquet of his public life. It was curt
      to the verge of harshness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the market quotation on beetles, judge?&rdquo; asked the young man,
      tapping the rug with his stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; demanded the other, drawing down his heavy
      brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The black beetle; the humble but brisk haunter of household crevices,&rdquo;
       explained Average Jones. &ldquo;You advertised for ten thousand specimens. I've
      got a few thousand I'd like to dispose of, if the inducements are
      sufficient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm in no mood for joking, young man,&rdquo; retorted the other, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seldom are, I understand,&rdquo; replied Average Jones blandly. &ldquo;Well, if
      you won't talk about bugs, let's talk about dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The topic does not interest me, sir,&rdquo; retorted the other, and the glance
      of his eye was baleful, but uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tapping of the young man's cane ceased. He looked up into his host's
      glowering face with a seraphic and innocent smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even if it&mdash;er&mdash;touched upon a device for guarding the
      street corners in case&mdash;er&mdash;Peter Paul went walking&mdash;er&mdash;once
      too often?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Ackroyd took one step forward. Average Jones was on his feet
      instantly, and, even in her alarm, Sylvia Graham noticed how swiftly and
      naturally his whole form &ldquo;set.&rdquo; But the big man turned away, and abruptly
      left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you wise to anger him?&rdquo; asked the girl, as the heavy tread died away
      on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes open declaration of war is the soundest strategy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;War?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;You make me feel like a traitor to my own family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the unfortunate part of it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but it can't be helped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spoke of having some one guard the corners of the block,&rdquo; continued
      the girl, after a thoughtful silence. &ldquo;Do you think I'd better arrange for
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need. There'll be a hundred people on watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you called out the militia?&rdquo; she asked, twinkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than that. I've employed the tools of my trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed her a galley proof marked with many corrections. She ran through
      it with growing amazement.
    </p>

     A. JONES: AD-VISOR
     ASTOR COURT TEMPLE, NEW YORK
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will appear in every New York paper tomorrow morning,&rdquo; explained its
      deviser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Any one who attempts to take Peter Paul away will
      be tracked by a band of boy detectives. A stroke of genius, Mr. Average.
      Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She curtsied low to him. But Average Jones was in no mood for playfulness
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That restricts the judge's endeavors to the house and garden,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;since, of course he'll see the advertisement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see that he does,&rdquo; said Miss Graham maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! I'll also ask you to watch the garden for any suspicious
      excavating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. But is that all?&rdquo; Miss Graham's voice was wistful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've been so good to me,&rdquo; she said hesitantly. &ldquo;I don't like to think
      of you as setting those boys to an impossible task.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bless you!&rdquo; returned the Ad-Visor heartily; &ldquo;that's all arranged for.
      One of my men will duly parade with a canine especially obtained for the
      occasion. I'm not going to swindle the youngsters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It didn't seem like you,&rdquo; returned Miss Graham warmly. &ldquo;But you must let
      me pay for it, that and the advertising bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As an unauthorized expense&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid a small, persuasive hand on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must let me pay it. Won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones was conscious of a strange sensation, starting from the
      point where the firm, little hand lay. It spread in his veins and
      thickened his speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he drawled, uncertainly, &ldquo;if you&mdash;er&mdash;put it&mdash;er&mdash;that
      way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hand lifted. &ldquo;Mr. Average Jones,&rdquo; said the owner, &ldquo;do you know you
      haven't once disappointed me in speech or action during our short but
      rather eventful acquaintance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you'll be able to say the same ten years from now,&rdquo; he returned
      significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flushed a little at the implication. &ldquo;What am I to do next?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do as you would ordinarily do; only don't take Peter Paul, into the
      street, or you'll have a score of high-school boys trailing you. And&mdash;this
      is the most important&mdash;if the dog fails to answer your call at any
      time, and you can't readily find him by searching, telephone me, at once,
      at my office. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are a very staunch friend to those who need you,&rdquo; she said,
      gravely and sweetly, giving him her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She clung in his mind like a remembered fragrance, after he had gone back
      to Astor Court Temple to wait. And though he plunged into an intricate
      scheme of political advertising which was to launch a new local party, her
      eyes and her voice haunted him. Nor had he banished them, when, two days
      later, the telephone brought him her clear accents, a little tremulous
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter Paul is gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since ten this morning. The house is in an uproar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be up in half an hour at the latest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do come quickly. I'm&mdash;I'm a little frightened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must have something to do,&rdquo; said Average Jones decisively. &ldquo;Have
      you been keeping an eye on the garden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go through it again, looking carefully for signs of disarranged earth. I
      don't think you'll find it, but it's well to be sure. Let me in at the
      basement door at half-past one. Judge Ackroyd mustn't see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a strangely misshapen presentation of the normally spick-and-span
      Average Jones that gently rang the basement bell of the old house at the
      specified hour. All his pockets bulged with lumpy angles. Immediately,
      upon being admitted by Miss Graham herself, he proceeded to disenburden
      himself of box after box, such as elastic bands come in, all exhibiting a
      homogeneous peculiarity, a hole at one end thinly covered with a
      gelatinous substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be very careful not to let that get broken,&rdquo; he instructed the mystified
      girl. &ldquo;In the course of an hour or so it will melt away itself. Did you
      see anything suspicious in the garden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; replied the girl. She picked up one of the boxes. &ldquo;How odd!&rdquo; she
      cried. &ldquo;Why, there's something in it that's alive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much so. Your friends, the beetles, in fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Again? Aren't you carrying the joke rather far?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not a joke any more. It's deadly serious. I'm quite sure,&rdquo; he
      concluded in the manner of one who picks his words carefully, &ldquo;that it may
      turn out to be just the most serious matter in the world to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As bad as that?&rdquo; she queried, but the color that flamed in her cheeks
      belied the lightness of her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite. However, that must wait. Where is your uncle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up-stairs in his study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you could take me all through the house sometime this
      afternoon without his seeing me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm sure I couldn't. He's been wandering like an uneasy spirit since
      Peter Paul disappeared. And he won't go out, because he is packing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the worse, either for him or me. Where are your rooms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the second floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Now, I want one of these little boxes left in every room in
      the house, if possible, except on your floor, which is probably out of the
      reckoning. Do you think you could manage it soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so. I'll try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do most of the rooms open into one another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, all through the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please see that they're all unlocked, and as far as possible, open. I'll
      be here at four o'clock, and will call for judge Ackroyd. You must be sure
      that he receives me. Tell him it is a matter of great importance. It is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're putting a fearful strain on my feminine curiosity,&rdquo; said Miss
      Graham, the provocative smile quirking at the comers of her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; returned the other dryly. &ldquo;If you strictly follow directions,
      I'll undertake to satisfy it in time. Four o'clock sharp, I'll be here.
      Don't be frightened whatever happens. You keep ready, but out of the way,
      until I call you. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With even more than his usual nicety was Average Jones attired, when, at
      four o'clock, he sent his card to judge Ackroyd. Small favor, however, did
      his appearance find, in the scowling eyes of the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take a cigar, thank you very much,&rdquo; said Average Jones innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll take your leave, or state your business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has to do with your niece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what do you take my time for, damn your impudence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't swear.&rdquo; Average Jones was deliberately provoking the older man to
      an outbreak. &ldquo;Let's&mdash;er&mdash;sit down and&mdash;er&mdash;be chatty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The drawl, actually an evidence of excitement, had all the effect of
      studied insolence. Judge Ackroyd's big frame shook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to k-k-kick you out into the street, you young p-p-p-pup,&rdquo; he
      stuttered in his rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      His knotted fingers writhed out for a hold on the other's collar. With a
      sinuous movement, the visitor swerved aside and struck the other man,
      flat-handed, across the face. There was an answering howl of demoniac
      fury. Then a strange thing happened. The assailant turned and fled, not to
      the ready egress of the front door, but down the dark stairway to the
      basement. The judge thundered after, in maddened, unthinking pursuit.
      Average Jones ran fleetly and easily. And his running was not for the
      purpose of flight alone, for as he sped through the basement rooms, he
      kept casting swift glances from side to side, and up and down the walls.
      The heavyweight pursuer could not get nearer than half a dozen paces.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the kitchen Average Jones burst into the hallway, doubled back up the
      stairs and made a tour of the big drawing-rooms and living-rooms of the
      first floor. Here, too, his glance swept room after room, from floor to
      ceiling. The chase then led upward to the second floor, and by direct
      ascent to the third. Breathing heavily, judge Ackroyd lumbered after the
      more active man. In his dogged rage, he never thought to stop and block
      the hall-way; but trailed his quarry like a bloodhound through every room
      of the third floor, and upward to the fourth. Half-way up this stairway,
      Average Jones checked his speed and surveyed the hall above. As he started
      again he stumbled and sprawled. A more competent observer than the
      infuriated pursuer might have noticed that he fell cunningly. But judge
      Ackroyd gave a shout of savage triumph and increased his speed. He
      stretched his hand to grip the fugitive. It had almost touched him when he
      leaped, to his feet and resumed his flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll get you now!&rdquo; panted the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourth floor of the old house was almost bare. In a hall-embrasure
      hung a full-length mirror. All along the borders of this, Average Jones'
      quick ranging vision had discerned small red-banded objects which moved
      and shifted. As the glass reflected his extended figure, it showed, almost
      at the same instant, the outstretched, bony hand of &ldquo;Oily&rdquo; Ackroyd. With a
      snarl, half rage, half satisfaction, the pursuer hurled himself forward&mdash;and
      fell, with a plunge that rattled the house's old bones. For, as he
      reached, Jones, trained on many a foot-ball field, had whirled and dived
      at his knees. Before the fallen man could gather his shaken wits, he was
      pinned with the most disabling grip known in the science of combat, a
      strangle-hold with the assailant's wrist clamped in below and behind the
      ear. Average Jones lifted his voice and the name that came to his lips was
      the name that had lurked subconsciously, in his heart, for days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvia!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The fourth floor! Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a stir and a cry from two floors below. Sylvia Graham had broken
      from the grasp of her terrified aunt, and now came up the sharp ascent
      like a deer, her eyes blazing with resolve and courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mirror,&rdquo; said Average Jones. &ldquo;Push it aside. Pull it down. Get behind
      it somehow. Lie quiet, Ackroyd or I'll have to choke your worthless head
      off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an effort of nervous strength, the girl lifted aside the big glass.
      Behind it a hundred scarlet banded insects swarmed and scampered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a panel. Open it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tugged at the woodwork with quick, clever fingers. A section loosened
      and fell outward with a bang. The red-and-black beetles fled in all
      directions. And now, judge Ackroyd found his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Murder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sinewy pressure of Average Jones' wrist smothered further attempts at
      vocality to a gurgle. He looked up into Sylvia Graham's tense, face, and
      jerked his head toward the opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless my little detectives have deceived me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you'll find the
      body in there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She groped, and drew forth a large box. In it was packed the body of Peter
      Paul. There was a cord about the fat neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strangled,&rdquo; whispered the girl. &ldquo;Poor old doggie!&rdquo; Then she whirled upon
      the prostrate man. &ldquo;You murderer!&rdquo; she said very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not murder to put a dying brute out of the way,&rdquo; said the shaken man
      sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's fraud, in this case,&rdquo; retorted Average Jones. &ldquo;A fraud of which
      you're self-convicted. Get up.&rdquo; He himself rose and stepped back, but his
      eye was intent, and his muscles were in readiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no more fight in judge &ldquo;Oily&rdquo; Ackroyd. He slunk to the stairs
      and limped heavily down to his frightened and sobbing wife. Miss Graham
      leaned against the wall, white and spent. Average Jones, his heart in his
      eyes, took a step forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said peremptorily. &ldquo;Don't touch me. I shall be all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind my saying,&rdquo; said he, very low, &ldquo;that you are the bravest and
      finest human being I've met in a&mdash;a somewhat varied career.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl shuddered. &ldquo;I could have stood it all,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but for those
      awful, crawling, red creatures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those?&rdquo; said Average Jones. &ldquo;Why, they were my bloodhounds, my little
      detectives. There's nothing very awful about those, Sylvia. They've done
      their work as nature gave 'em to do it. I knew that as soon as they got
      out, they would find the trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carrion beetles,&rdquo; said Average Jones. &ldquo;Where the vultures of the insect
      kingdom are gathered together, there the quarry lies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia Graham drew a long breath. &ldquo;I'm all right now,&rdquo; she pronounced.
      &ldquo;There's nothing left, I suppose, but to leave this house. And to thank
      you. How am I ever to thank you?&rdquo; She lifted her eyes to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the thanks,&rdquo; said Average Jones unevenly. &ldquo;It was nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was everything! It was wonderful!&rdquo; cried the girl, and held out her
      slender hands to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they clasped warmly upon his, Average Jones' reason lost its balance.
      He forgot that he was in that house on an equivocal footing; he forgot
      that he had exposed and disgraced Sylvia Graham's near relative; he forgot
      that this was but his third meeting with Sylvia Graham herself; he forgot
      everything except that the sum total of all that was sweetest and finest
      and most desirable in womanhood stood warm and vivid before him; and,
      bending over the little, clinging hands, he pressed his lips to them. Only
      for a moment. The hands slipped from his. There was a quick, frightened
      gasp, and the girl's face, all aflush with a new, sweet fearfulness and
      wondering confusion, vanished behind a ponderous swinging door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man's knees shook a little as he walked forward and put his lips
      close to the lintel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a faint rustle from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry. I mean, I'm glad. Gladder than of anything I've ever done in
      my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I've frightened you, forgive me. I couldn't help it. It was stronger
      than I. This isn't the place where I can tell you. Sylvia, I'm going now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The work is done,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;You won't need me any more.&rdquo; Did he
      hear, from within, a faint indrawn breath? &ldquo;Not for any help that I can
      give. But I&mdash;I shall need you always, and long for you. Listen, there
      mustn't be any misunderstanding about this, dear. If you send for me, it
      must be because you want me; knowing that, when I come, I shall come for
      you. Good-by, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo; It was the merest whisper from behind the door. But it echoed
      in the tones of a thousand golden hopes and dismal fears in the whirling
      brain of Average Jones as he walked back to his offices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later he sat at his desk, in a murk of woe. Nor word nor sign had
      come to him from Miss Sylvia Graham. He frowned heavily as Simpson entered
      the inner sanctum with the usual packet of clippings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave them,&rdquo; he ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; The confidential clerk lingered, looking uncomfortable.
      &ldquo;Anything from yesterday's lot, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't looked them over yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or day before's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't taken those up either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, Mr. Jones., but&mdash;are you ill, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; snapped Average Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ramson is inquiring whether he shall ship more beetles. I see in the
      paper that judge Ackroyd has sailed for Europe on six hours' notice, so I
      suppose you won't want any more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Average Jones mentioned a destination for Rawson's beetles deeper than
      they had, ever digged for prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo; assented Simpson. &ldquo;But if I might suggest, there's a very
      interesting advertisement in yesterday's paper repeated this morn&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sir. But&mdash;but still&mdash;it&mdash;it seems to have a strange
      reference to the burial of the million-dollar dog, and an invitation that
      I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it? Give it to me!&rdquo; For once in his life, high pressure of
      excitement had blotted out Average Jones' drawl. His employee thrust into
      his hand this announcement from the Banner of that morning:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     DIED-At 100 West 26th Street, Sept. 14,
     Peter Paul, a dog, for many years the faithful
     and fond companion of the late Amelia Van
     Haltern.  Burial in accordance with the wish
     and will of Mrs. Van Haltern, at the family estate,
     Schuylkill, Sept. 17, at o'clock.  His friend, Don
     Quixote, is especially bidden to come, if he will.
</pre>
    <p>
      Average Jones leaped to his feet. &ldquo;My parable,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Don Quixote and
      the damsel in distress. Where's my hat? Where's the time-table? Get a cab!
      Simpson, you idiot, why didn't you make me read this before, confound you!
      I mean God bless you. Your salary's doubled from to-day. I'm off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo; said the bewildered Simpson, &ldquo;but about Ramson's beetles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him, to turn 'em out to pasture and keep 'em as long as they live,
      at my expense,&rdquo; called back Average Jones as the door slammed behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Sylvia Graham looked down upon a slender finger ornamented with the
      oddest and the most appropriate of engagement rings, a scarab beetle
      red-banded with three deep-hued rubies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Average,&rdquo; she said, and the golden laughter flickered again in the
      brown depths of her eyes, &ldquo;not even you could expect a girl to accept a
      man through a keyhole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; said Average Jones with a sigh of profoundest content.
      &ldquo;Some are for privacy in these matters; others for publicity. But I
      suppose I'm the first man in history who ever got his heart's answer in an
      advertisement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      THE END <br /> <br />

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
